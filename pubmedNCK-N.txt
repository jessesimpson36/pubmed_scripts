TI  - Somatic PTPN11 Mutation in a Child With Neuroblastoma and Protein Losing
      Enteropathy.
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000903 [doi]
AB  - Neuroblastoma and protein losing enteropathy (PLE) are diagnoses commonly seen by
      oncologists and gastroenterologists, respectively. The concurrence of these 2
      entities is rare, and not well explained. We describe the sixth case of PLE in a 
      child with neuroblastoma, and the first for which genetic information is
      available. Tumor DNA had a mutation in the PTPN11 gene, which has been described 
      in neuroblastoma, and in Noonan syndrome-a diagnosis in which neuroblastoma and
      PLE independently have been reported. Constitutional DNA was normal. Genetic
      studies in future patients will be needed to support the link between
      neuroblastoma and PLE.

TI  - Actigraphy-Derived Daily Rest-Activity Patterns and Body Mass Index in
      Community-Dwelling Adults.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx168 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine associations between 24-hour rest-activity patterns 
      and body mass index (BMI) among community-dwelling US adults. Rest-activity
      patterns provide a field method to study exposures related to circadian rhythms. 
      Methods: Adults (N = 578) wore an actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7
      days. Intradaily variability and interdaily stability (IS), M10 (most active
      10-hours), L5 (least active 5-hours), and relative amplitude (RA) were derived
      using nonparametric rhythm analysis. Mesor, acrophase, and amplitude were
      calculated from log-transformed count data using the parametric cosinor approach.
      Results: Participants were 80% female and mean (standard deviation) age was 52
      (15) years. Participants with higher BMI had lower values for magnitude, RA, IS, 
      total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency. In multivariable analyses, less
      robust 24-hour rest-activity patterns as represented by lower RA were
      consistently associated with higher BMI: comparing the bottom quintile (least
      robust) to the top quintile (most robust 24-hour rest-activity pattern) of RA,
      BMI was 3-kg/m2 higher (p = .02). Associations were similar in magnitude to an
      hour less of TST (1-kg/m2 higher BMI) or a 10% decrease in sleep efficiency
      (2-kg/m2 higher BMI), and independent of age, sex, race, education, and the
      duration of rest and/or activity. Conclusions: Lower RA, reflecting both higher
      night activity and lower daytime activity, was associated with higher BMI.
      Independent of the duration of rest or activity during the day or night, 24-hour 
      rest, and activity patterns from actigraphy provide aggregated measures of
      activity that associate with BMI in community-dwelling adults.

AB  - Rest-activity patterns provide an indication of circadian rhythmicity in the
      free-living setting. We aimed to describe the distributions of rest-activity
      patterns in a sample of adults and children across demographic variables. A
      sample of adults (N = 590) and children (N = 58) wore an actigraph on their
      nondominant wrist for 7 days and nights. We generated rest-activity patterns from
      cosinor analysis (MESOR, acrophase and magnitude) and nonparametric circadian
      rhythm analysis (IS: interdaily stability; IV: intradaily variability; L5: least 
      active 5-hour period; M10: most active 10-hour period; and RA: relative
      amplitude). Demographic variables included age, sex, race, education, marital
      status, and income. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for demographic
      differences in rest-activity patterns. Adolescents, compared to younger children,
      had (1) later M10 midpoints (beta = 1.12 hours [95% CI: 0.43, 1.18] and lower M10
      activity levels; (2) later L5 midpoints (beta = 1.6 hours [95% CI: 0.9, 2.3]) and
      lower L5 activity levels; (3) less regular rest-activity patterns (lower IS and
      higher IV); and 4) lower magnitudes (beta = -0.95 [95% CI: -1.28, -0.63]) and
      relative amplitudes (beta = -0.1 [95% CI: -0.14, -0.06]). Mid-to-older adults,
      compared to younger adults (aged 18-29 years), had (1) earlier M10 midpoints
      (beta = -1.0 hours [95% CI: -1.6, -0.4]; (2) earlier L5 midpoints (beta = -0.7
      hours [95% CI: -1.2, -0.2]); and (3) more regular rest-activity patterns (higher 
      IS and lower IV). The magnitudes and relative amplitudes were similar across the 
      adult age categories. Sex, race and education level rest-activity differences
      were also observed. Rest-activity patterns vary across the lifespan, and differ
      by race, sex and education. Understanding population variation in these patterns 
      provides a foundation for further elucidating the health implications of
      rest-activity patterns across the lifespan.

TI  - Fungi that Infect Humans.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.FUNK-0014-2016 [doi]
AB  - Fungi must meet four criteria to infect humans: growth at human body
      temperatures, circumvention or penetration of surface barriers, lysis and
      absorption of tissue, and resistance to immune defenses, including elevated body 
      temperatures. Morphogenesis between small round, detachable cells and long,
      connected cells is the mechanism by which fungi solve problems of locomotion
      around or through host barriers. Secretion of lytic enzymes, and uptake systems
      for the released nutrients, are necessary if a fungus is to nutritionally utilize
      human tissue. Last, the potent human immune system evolved in the interaction
      with potential fungal pathogens, so few fungi meet all four conditions for a
      healthy human host. Paradoxically, the advances of modern medicine have made
      millions of people newly susceptible to fungal infections by disrupting immune
      defenses. This article explores how different members of four fungal phyla use
      different strategies to fulfill the four criteria to infect humans: the
      Entomophthorales, the Mucorales, the Ascomycota, and the Basidiomycota. Unique
      traits confer human pathogenic potential on various important members of these
      phyla: pathogenic Onygenales comprising thermal dimorphs such as Histoplasma and 
      Coccidioides; the Cryptococcus spp. that infect immunocompromised as well as
      healthy humans; and important pathogens of immunocompromised patients-Candida,
      Pneumocystis, and Aspergillus spp. Also discussed are agents of neglected
      tropical diseases important in global health such as mycetoma and
      paracoccidiomycosis and common pathogens rarely implicated in serious illness
      such as dermatophytes. Commensalism is considered, as well as parasitism, in
      shaping genomes and physiological systems of hosts and fungi during evolution.

AB  - Gene-editing technologies have made it feasible to create nonhuman primate models
      for human genetic disorders. Here, we report detailed genotypes and phenotypes of
      TALEN-edited MECP2 mutant cynomolgus monkeys serving as a model for a
      neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT), which is caused by
      loss-of-function mutations in the human MECP2 gene. Male mutant monkeys were
      embryonic lethal, reiterating that RTT is a disease of females. Through a battery
      of behavioral analyses, including primate-unique eye-tracking tests, in
      combination with brain imaging via MRI, we found a series of physiological,
      behavioral, and structural abnormalities resembling clinical manifestations of
      RTT. Moreover, blood transcriptome profiling revealed that mutant monkeys
      resembled RTT patients in immune gene dysregulation. Taken together, the stark
      similarity in phenotype and/or endophenotype between monkeys and patients
      suggested that gene-edited RTT founder monkeys would be of value for disease
      mechanistic studies as well as development of potential therapeutic interventions
      for RTT.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis: Results From an NTM Info 
      & Research Patient Survey and the Bronchiectasis and NTM Research Registry.
PG  - 1120-1127
LID - S0012-3692(17)30810-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis ("bronchiectasis") is a chronic
      inflammatory lung disease often associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
      infection. Very little data exist to guide bronchiectasis management decisions.
      We sought to describe patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and antibiotic
      therapy in the United States. METHODS: We invited 2,000 patients through NTM Info
      & Research (NTMir) to complete an anonymous electronic survey. We separately
      queried baseline clinical and laboratory data from the US Bronchiectasis and NTM 
      Research Registry (BRR). RESULTS: Among 511 NTMir survey responders with
      bronchiectasis, whose median age was 67 years, 85 (17%) reported asthma and 99
      (19%) reported COPD. History of ICS use was reported by 282 (55%), 171 (61%) of
      whom were treated 1 year or longer, and 150 (53%) were currently taking ICSs.
      Fewer reported ever taking azithromycin for non-NTM bronchiectasis (203
      responders [40%]) or inhaled tobramycin (78 responders [15%]). The median age of 
      1,912 BRR patients was 69 years; 528 (28%) had asthma and 360 (19%) had COPD.
      Among 740 patients (42%) without NTM, 314 were taking ICSs at baseline. Among
      patients without NTM who were taking ICSs, only 178 (57%) had a concurrent
      diagnosis of COPD or asthma that could explain ICS use. Fewer were taking
      suppressive macrolides (96 patients [13%]), and of the 70 patients (10%) taking
      inhaled suppressive antibiotics, 48 (68%) had chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      infection. CONCLUSIONS: ICS use was common in two national samples of patients
      with bronchiectasis, with relatively few patients taking suppressive antibiotic
      therapies. Further research is needed to clarify the safety and effectiveness of 
      these therapies in patients with bronchiectasis.

TI  - Adolescents at clinical-high risk for psychosis: Circadian rhythm disturbances
      predict worsened prognosis at 1-year follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with psychotic disorders experience disruptions to both
      the sleep and circadian components of the sleep/wake cycle. Recent evidence has
      supported a role of sleep disturbances in emerging psychosis. However, less is
      known about how circadian rhythm disruptions may relate to psychosis symptoms and
      prognosis for adolescents with clinical high-risk (CHR) syndromes. The present
      study examines circadian rest/activity rhythms in CHR and healthy control (HC)
      youth to clarify the relationships among circadian rhythm disturbance, psychosis 
      symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and the longitudinal course of illness.
      METHODS: Thirty-four CHR and 32 HC participants were administered a baseline
      evaluation, which included clinical interviews, 5days of actigraphy, and a
      sleep/activity diary. CHR (n=29) participants were re-administered clinical
      interviews at a 1-year follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Relative to HC, CHR youth
      exhibited more fragmented circadian rhythms and later onset of nocturnal rest.
      Circadian disturbances (fragmented rhythms, low daily activity) were associated
      with increased psychotic symptom severity among CHR participants at baseline.
      Circadian disruptions (lower daily activity, rhythms that were more fragmented
      and/or desynchronized with the light/dark cycle) also predicted severity of
      psychosis symptoms and psychosocial impairment at 1-year follow-up among CHR
      youth. CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythm disturbances may represent a potential
      vulnerability marker for emergence of psychosis, and thus, rest/activity rhythm
      stabilization has promise to inform early-identification and
      prevention/intervention strategies for CHR youth. Future studies with longer
      study designs are necessary to further examine circadian rhythms in the prodromal
      period and rates of conversion to psychosis among CHR teens.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the characteristics of adult patients with
      bronchiectasis enrolled in the US Bronchiectasis Research Registry (BRR).
      METHODS: The BRR is a database of patients with non-cystic-fibrosis
      bronchiectasis (NCFB) enrolled at 13 sites in the United States. Baseline
      demographic, spirometric, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data were
      entered into a central Internet-based database. Patients were subsequently
      analyzed by the presence of NTM. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,826 patients between 2008
      and 2014. Patients were predominantly women (79%), white (89%), and never smokers
      (60%), with a mean age of 64 +/- 14 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients
      had a history of NTM disease or NTM isolated at baseline evaluation for entry
      into the BRR. Patients with NTM were older, predominantly women, and had
      bronchiectasis diagnosed at a later age than those without NTM. Gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease (GERD) was more common in those with NTM, whereas asthma, primary 
      immunodeficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia were more common in those
      without NTM. Fifty-one percent of patients had spirometric evidence of airflow
      obstruction. Patients with NTM were more likely to have diffusely dilated airways
      and tree-in-bud abnormalities. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus isolates
      were cultured less commonly in patients with NTM. Bronchial hygiene measures were
      used more often in those with NTM, whereas antibiotics used for exacerbations,
      rotating oral antibiotics, steroid use, and inhaled bronchodilators were more
      commonly used in those without NTM. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with
      bronchiectasis enrolled in the US BRR are described, with differences noted in
      demographic, radiographic, microbiological, and treatment variables based on
      stratification of the presence of NTM.

AB  - Lung infections with Mycobacterium abscessus, a species of multidrug-resistant
      nontuberculous mycobacteria, are emerging as an important global threat to
      individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), in whom M. abscessus accelerates
      inflammatory lung damage, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
      Previously, M. abscessus was thought to be independently acquired by susceptible 
      individuals from the environment. However, using whole-genome analysis of a
      global collection of clinical isolates, we show that the majority of M. abscessus
      infections are acquired through transmission, potentially via fomites and
      aerosols, of recently emerged dominant circulating clones that have spread
      globally. We demonstrate that these clones are associated with worse clinical
      outcomes, show increased virulence in cell-based and mouse infection models, and 
      thus represent an urgent international infection challenge.

      Significant Differences in Time to Evaluation and Symptoms at Presentation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare time to evaluation and symptoms at diagnosis of propionic 
      acidemia (PA) by method of ascertainment, and to explore correlations between
      genotype and biochemical variables. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical symptoms, genotype,
      and biochemical findings were analyzed retrospectively in 58 individuals with PA 
      enrolled in the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Information System (IBEM-IS) based on
      the type of initial ascertainment: abnormal newborn screening (NBS), clinical
      presentation (symptomatic), or family history. RESULTS: The average age at
      initial evaluation and treatment was significantly younger in patients
      ascertained via abnormal NBS compared with those referred for clinical symptoms. 
      Furthermore, the majority of individuals ascertained because of abnormal NBS were
      asymptomatic at diagnosis, compared with a minority of clinical presentations. A 
      notable difference in the frequency of metabolic acidosis at initial presentation
      was observed between those with abnormal NBS (12.5%; 2 of 16) and those with an
      abnormal clinical presentation (79%; 19 of 24). The frequency of hyperammonemia
      was similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our data support the continued value of 
      NBS to identify individuals with PA, who are diagnosed and treated earlier than
      for other modes of ascertainment. There were no statistically significant
      correlations between genotype and NBS for C3 acylcarnitines. Although expanded
      use of NBS has allowed for early diagnosis and treatment, long-term outcomes of
      individuals with PA, especially with respect to mode of ascertainment, remain
      unclear and would benefit from a longitudinal study.

TI  - Identification of mycobacterium spp. and nocardia spp. from solid and liquid

      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

AB  - Identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF MS has been widely accepted in
      clinical microbiology. However, for Mycobacterium spp. and Nocardia spp. such
      identification has not yet reached the optimal level of routine testing. Here we 
      describe the development of an identification tool for 49 and 15 species of
      Mycobacterium spp. and Nocardia spp., respectively. During database construction,
      a number of ambiguous reference identifications were revealed and corrected via
      molecular analyses. Eventually, more than 2000 individual mass spectra acquired
      from 494 strains were included in a reference database and subjected to
      bio-statistical analyses. This led to correct species identification and correct 
      combination of species into several complexes or groups, such as the
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. With the Advanced Spectrum Classifier
      algorithm, class-specific bin weights were determined and tested by
      cross-validation experiments with good results. When challenged with independent 
      isolates, overall identification performance was 90% for identification of
      Mycobacterium spp. and 88% for Nocardia spp. However, for a number of
      Mycobacterium sp. isolates, no identification could be achieved and in most
      cases, this could be attributed to the production of polymers that masked the
      species-specific protein peak patterns. For the species where >20 isolates were
      tested, correct identification reached 95% or higher. With the current spectral

PG  - 227-43
LID - 10.1093/emph/eow018 [doi]
AB  - Sleep is essential to cognitive function and health in humans, yet the ultimate
      reasons for sleep-i.e. 'why' sleep evolved-remain mysterious. We integrate
      findings from human sleep studies, the ethnographic record, and the ecology and
      evolution of mammalian sleep to better understand sleep along the human lineage
      and in the modern world. Compared to other primates, sleep in great apes has
      undergone substantial evolutionary change, with all great apes building a
      sleeping platform or 'nest'. Further evolutionary change characterizes human
      sleep, with humans having the shortest sleep duration, yet the highest proportion
      of rapid eye movement sleep among primates. These changes likely reflect that our
      ancestors experienced fitness benefits from being active for a greater portion of
      the 24-h cycle than other primates, potentially related to advantages arising
      from learning, socializing and defending against predators and hostile
      conspecifics. Perspectives from evolutionary medicine have implications for
      understanding sleep disorders; we consider these perspectives in the context of
      insomnia, narcolepsy, seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and
      sleep apnea. We also identify how human sleep today differs from sleep through
      most of human evolution, and the implications of these changes for global health 
      and health disparities. More generally, our review highlights the importance of
      phylogenetic comparisons in understanding human health, including well-known
      links between sleep, cognitive performance and health in humans.

TI  - Sleep, Fatigue and Quality of Life: A Comparative Analysis among Night Shift
      Workers with and without Children.
PG  - e0158580
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158580 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The reversal of the natural cycle of wakefulness and sleep may
      cause damage to the health of workers. However, there are few studies evaluating 
      sleep, fatigue and quality of life of night shift workers considering the
      influence of small children on these variables. AIMS: Evaluate the sleep time,
      fatigue and quality of life of night shift workers and verify the relationship
      between these variables with the presence or absence of children in different age
      groups. METHODS: Were evaluated 78 mens shiftworkers, with or without children.
      Group 1, workers without children (G1-NC), group 2, workers with children
      pre-school age (G2-PS) and group 3, workers with children school age (G3-S). The 
      sleep time (ST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency (SL) and maximum time awake
      (MTA) were recorded by actigraphy. The risk of being fatigued at work was
      estimated by risk index for fatigue (RIF). RESULTS: The G1-NC showed a longer ST 
      on working days and when evaluated only the first nights shift, after day off
      (p<0,005). This sample, the age of the children did not influence the sleep time 
      these workers. The MTA on day off was lower in the workers from G2-PS. The RIF
      was lower on G1-NC in the first nights shift compared to the other groups.
      CONCLUSION: In this research, workers without children had higher sleep time
      during the working days. These workers also were less likely to feel fatigued
      during night work than workers with children, regardless of age these children.

AB  - Period (PER) protein phosphorylation is a critical regulator of circadian period,
      yet an integrated understanding of the role and interaction between
      phosphorylation sites that can both increase and decrease PER2 stability remains 
      elusive. Here, we propose a phosphoswitch model, where two competing
      phosphorylation sites determine whether PER2 has a fast or slow degradation rate.
      This mathematical model accurately reproduces the three-stage degradation
      kinetics of endogenous PER2. We predict and demonstrate that the phosphoswitch is
      intrinsically temperature sensitive, slowing down PER2 degradation as a result of
      faster reactions at higher temperatures. The phosphoswitch provides a biochemical
      mechanism for circadian temperature compensation of circadian period. This
      phosphoswitch additionally explains the phenotype of Familial Advanced Sleep
      Phase (FASP) and CK1epsilon(tau) genetic circadian rhythm disorders, metabolic
      control of PER2 stability, and how drugs that inhibit CK1 alter period. The
      phosphoswitch provides a general mechanism to integrate diverse stimuli to
      regulate circadian period.

TI  - Work patterns, sleeping hours and excess weight in commercial drivers.
PG  - 725-31
LID - 10.1093/occmed/kqv080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work and sleep patterns for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers
      often include long working hours, shift work and diminished sleep duration and
      quality, which have been linked to overweight, obesity and other problems. AIMS: 
      To explore possible connections between work, sleep and obesity among CMV
      drivers. METHODS: Survey and anthropometric data were collected from male
      long-haul CMV drivers in central North Carolina, USA, over a period of 6 months. 
      Drivers' body mass index (BMI) was used as a measure of total body obesity and
      sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) as a measure of central adiposity. RESULTS:
      Among the 260 study subjects, mean BMI was 33.1 (64% were obese or morbidly
      obese) and mean SAD was 32.3cm, classifying 89% of drivers as being at high or
      very high cardiometabolic risk. About 83% of drivers worked an irregular daily
      schedule, 64% worked irregular total daily hours, 32% worked irregular days of
      the week and 46% reported getting <7h of sleep during work nights. Significant
      predictors of BMI included the number of hours worked daily (P < 0.05) and the
      age (P < 0.01) of the driver, while age was also a significant predictor for SAD 
      (P < 0.05). Significant predictors of sleep quality included the extent of shift 
      work (P < 0.05) and sleep duration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Work and sleep
      configurations appear to affect the weight status of CMV drivers. Shift work and 
      sleep duration are both associated with the weight status of CMV drivers, and
      both appear to function as indicators of their sleep quality.

TI  - Cardiac hypertrophy induced by active Raf depends on Yorkie-mediated
      transcription.
PG  - ra13
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005719 [doi]
AB  - Organ hypertrophy can result from enlargement of individual cells or from cell
      proliferation or both. Activating mutations in the serine-threonine kinase Raf
      cause cardiac hypertrophy and contribute to Noonan syndrome in humans.
      Cardiac-specific expression of activated Raf also causes hypertrophy in
      Drosophila melanogaster. We found that Yorkie (Yki), a transcriptional
      coactivator in the Hippo pathway that regulates organ size, is required for
      Raf-induced cardiac hypertrophy in flies. Although aberrant activation of Yki
      orthologs stimulates cardiac hyperplasia in mice, cardiac-specific expression of 
      an activated mutant form of Yki in fruit flies caused cardiac hypertrophy without
      hyperplasia. Knockdown of Yki caused cardiac dilation without loss of
      cardiomyocytes and prevented Raf-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In flies,
      Yki-induced cardiac hypertrophy required the TEA domain-containing transcription 
      factor Scalloped, and, in mammalian cells, expression of mouse Raf(L613V), an
      activated form of Raf with a Noonan syndrome mutation, increased Yki-induced
      Scalloped activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Tgi (a Tondu domain-containing
      Scalloped-binding corepressor) in the fly heart abrogated Yki- or Raf-induced
      cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, crosstalk between Raf and Yki occurs in the heart and 
      can influence Raf-mediated cardiac hypertrophy.

TI  - Social jetlag, obesity and metabolic disorder: investigation in a cohort study.
PG  - 842-8
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2014.201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. 
      Circadian rhythms are known to control both sleep timing and energy homeostasis, 
      and disruptions in circadian rhythms have been linked with metabolic dysfunction 
      and obesity-associated disease. In previous research, social jetlag, a measure of
      chronic circadian disruption caused by the discrepancy between our internal
      versus social clocks, was associated with elevated self-reported body mass index,
      possibly indicative of a more generalized association with obesity and metabolic 
      dysfunction. METHODS: We studied participants from the population-representative 
      Dunedin Longitudinal Study (N=1037) to determine whether social jetlag was
      associated with clinically assessed measurements of metabolic phenotypes and
      disease indicators for obesity-related disease, specifically, indicators of
      inflammation and diabetes. RESULTS: Our analysis was restricted to N=815
      non-shift workers in our cohort. Among these participants, we found that social
      jetlag was associated with numerous clinically assessed measures of metabolic
      dysfunction and obesity. We distinguished between obese individuals who were
      metabolically healthy versus unhealthy, and found higher social jetlag levels in 
      metabolically unhealthy obese individuals. Among metabolically unhealthy obese
      individuals, social jetlag was additionally associated with elevated glycated
      hemoglobin and an indicator of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are
      consistent with the possibility that 'living against our internal clock' may
      contribute to metabolic dysfunction and its consequences. Further research aimed 
      at understanding that the physiology and social features of social jetlag may
      inform obesity prevention and have ramifications for policies and practices that 
      contribute to increased social jetlag, such as work schedules and daylight
      savings time.

TI  - Sleep, fatigue, depression, and circadian activity rhythms in women with breast
      cancer before and after treatment: a 1-year longitudinal study.
PG  - 2535-45
LID - 10.1007/s00520-014-2204-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sleep disturbance, fatigue and depression are common complaints in
      patients with cancer, and often contribute to worse quality of life (QoL).
      Circadian activity rhythms (CARs) are often disrupted in cancer patients. These
      symptoms worsen during treatment, but less is known about their long-term
      trajectory. METHODS: Sixty-eight women with stage I-III breast cancer (BC)
      scheduled to receive >/=4 cycles of chemotherapy, and age-, ethnicity-, and
      education-matched normal, cancer-free controls (NC) participated. Sleep was
      measured with actigraphy (nocturnal total sleep time [nocturnal TST] and daytime 
      total nap time [NAPTIME]) and with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI);
      fatigue with the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF);
      depression with the Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D). CARs
      were derived from actigraphy. Several measures of QoL were administered. Data
      were collected at three time points: before (baseline), end of cycle 4 (cycle 4),
      and 1 year post-chemotherapy (1 year). RESULTS: Compared to NC, BC had longer
      NAPTIME, worse sleep quality, more fatigue, more depressive symptoms, more
      disrupted CARs, and worse QoL at baseline (all p values <0.05). At cycle 4, BC
      showed worse sleep, increased fatigue, more depressive symptoms, and more
      disrupted CARs compared to their own baseline levels and to NC (all p values
      <0.05). By 1 year, BC's fatigue, depressive symptoms, and QoL returned to
      baseline levels but were still worse than those of NC, while NAPTIME and CARs did
      not differ from NC's. CONCLUSION: Additional research is needed to determine if
      beginning treatment of these symptoms before the start of chemotherapy will
      minimize symptom severity over time.

TI  - Sustained attention performance during sleep deprivation associates with
      instability in behavior and physiologic measures at baseline.
PG  - 27-39
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3302 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify baseline behavioral and physiologic markers that
      associate with individual differences in sustained attention during sleep
      deprivation. DESIGN: In a retrospective study, ocular, electrocardiogram, and
      electroencephalogram (EEG) measures were compared in subjects who were
      characterized as resilient (n = 15) or vulnerable (n = 15) to the effects of
      total sleep deprivation on sustained attention. SETTING: Chronobiology and Sleep 
      Laboratory, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy
      volunteers aged 22-32 years from the general population. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects 
      were kept awake for at least 26 hours under constant environmental conditions.
      Every 2 hours, sustained attention was assessed using a 10-minute psychomotor
      vigilance task (PVT). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During baseline sleep and
      recovery sleep, EEG slow wave activity was similar in resilient versus vulnerable
      subjects, suggesting that individual differences in vulnerability to sleep loss
      were not related to differences in homeostatic sleep regulation. Rather,
      irrespective of time elapsed since wake, subjects who were vulnerable to sleep
      deprivation exhibited slower and more variable PVT response times, lower and more
      variable heart rate, and higher and more variable EEG spectral power in the theta
      frequency band (6.0-7.5 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: Performance decrements in sustained
      attention during sleep deprivation associate with instability in behavioral and
      physiologic measures at baseline. Small individual differences in sustained
      attention that are present at baseline are amplified during prolonged
      wakefulness, thus contributing to large between-subjects differences in
      performance and sleepiness.

TI  - Complete genome sequence analysis of Nocardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 reveals a
      saprobic lifestyle and the genes needed for human pathogenesis.
PG  - e65425
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0065425 [doi]
AB  - Nocardia brasiliensis is an important etiologic agent of mycetoma. These bacteria
      live as a saprobe in soil or organic material and enter the tissue via minor
      trauma. Mycetoma is characterized by tumefaction and the production of fistula
      and abscesses, with no spontaneous cure. By using mass sequencing, we determined 
      the complete genomic nucleotide sequence of the bacteria. According to our data, 
      the genome is a circular chromosome 9,436,348-bp long with 68% G+C content that
      encodes 8,414 proteins. We observed orthologs for virulence factors, a higher
      number of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and catabolism, and gene clusters 
      for the synthesis of bioactive compounds, such as antibiotics, terpenes, and
      polyketides. An in silico analysis of the sequence supports the conclusion that
      the bacteria acquired diverse genes by horizontal transfer from other soil
      bacteria, even from eukaryotic organisms. The genome composition reflects the
      evolution of bacteria via the acquisition of a large amount of DNA, which allows 
      it to survive in new ecological niches, including humans.

TI  - The neural crest in cardiac congenital anomalies.
PG  - 25-40
LID - 10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.005 [doi]
AB  - This review discusses the function of neural crest as they relate to
      cardiovascular defects. The cardiac neural crest cells are a subpopulation of
      cranial neural crest discovered nearly 30 years ago by ablation of premigratory
      neural crest. The cardiac neural crest cells are necessary for normal
      cardiovascular development. We begin with a description of the crest cells in
      normal development, including their function in remodeling the pharyngeal arch
      arteries, outflow tract septation, valvulogenesis, and development of the cardiac
      conduction system. The cells are also responsible for modulating signaling in the
      caudal pharynx, including the second heart field. Many of the molecular pathways 
      that are known to influence specification, migration, patterning and final
      targeting of the cardiac neural crest cells are reviewed. The cardiac neural
      crest cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various human
      cardiocraniofacial syndromes such as DiGeorge, Velocardiofacial, CHARGE, Fetal
      Alcohol, Alagille, LEOPARD, and Noonan syndromes, as well as Retinoic Acid
      Embryopathy. The loss of neural crest cells or their dysfunction may not always
      directly cause abnormal cardiovascular development, but are involved secondarily 
      because crest cells represent a major component in the complex tissue
      interactions in the head, pharynx and outflow tract. Thus many of the human
      syndromes linking defects in the heart, face and brain can be better understood
      when considered within the context of a single cardiocraniofacial developmental
      module with the neural crest being a key cell type that interconnects the
      regions.

TI  - How the circadian rhythm affects sleep, wakefulness, and overall health:
      background for understanding shift work disorder.
PG  - e05
LID - 10.4088/JCP.11073br1 [doi]
AB  - It is estimated that 15 to 25% of the U.S. labor force works night, evening, or
      rotating shifts. These non-traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm,
      a self-sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in
      modulating sleep/wake function, resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder,
      shift work type, usually referred to as shift work disorder. The disorder
      consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in
      insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours.
      Clinicians need more information about the role of the circadian rhythm in human 
      functioning as well as the pathophysiology, prevalence, and consequences of shift
      work disorder, so that they can recognize and diagnose this problem in clinical
      practice.

TI  - Life events and social rhythms in bipolar spectrum disorders: an examination of
      social rhythm sensitivity.
PG  - 264-72
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the presence of an underlying social rhythm sensitivity in
      individuals with bipolar spectrum disorders. METHODS: The present study examined 
      the impact of life events on sleep loss and social rhythm disruption in 184
      individuals with bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD) compared to 197 demographically
      similar normal controls (NC) drawn from the Longitudinal Investigation of Bipolar
      Spectrum Disorders (LIBS) project. Life events data were obtained at three time
      points, each spaced four months apart, and included information on the intensity 
      of the event (high or low), valence (negative or positive), and levels of sleep
      loss and social rhythm disruption brought about the event. We hypothesized that
      BSD participants would exhibit higher levels of social rhythm disruption and
      sleep loss than normal controls as a consequence of the same life events.
      RESULTS: BSD participants experienced significantly more social rhythm disruption
      and sleep loss following all classes of life events. LIMITATIONS: The
      cross-sectional design of this study limits the strength of the conclusions that 
      can be drawn, primarily cause and effect relationships between social rhythms and
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the presence of an underlying social
      rhythm sensitivity in individuals with bipolar spectrum disorders. An additive
      effect of sleep loss and social rhythm disruption may contribute to subsequent
      mood symptomatology. Results from this study may inform early psychosocial
      interventions for at-risk individuals.

TI  - SHP-2 acts via ROCK to regulate the cardiac actin cytoskeleton.
PG  - 948-57
LID - 10.1242/dev.067579 [doi]
AB  - Noonan syndrome is one of the most common causes of human congenital heart
      disease and is frequently associated with missense mutations in the protein
      phosphatase SHP-2. Interestingly, patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and
      LEOPARD syndrome frequently carry a second, somatically introduced subset of
      missense mutations in SHP-2. To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms
      by which SHP-2 regulates heart development and, thus, understand how
      Noonan-associated mutations affect cardiogenesis, we introduced SHP-2 encoding
      the most prevalent Noonan syndrome and JMML mutations into Xenopus embryos.
      Resulting embryos show a direct relationship between a Noonan SHP-2 mutation and 
      its ability to cause cardiac defects in Xenopus; embryos expressing Noonan SHP-2 
      mutations exhibit morphologically abnormal hearts, whereas those expressing an
      SHP-2 JMML-associated mutation do not. Our studies indicate that the cardiac
      defects associated with the introduction of the Noonan-associated SHP-2 mutations
      are coupled with a delay or arrest of the cardiac cell cycle in M-phase and a
      failure of cardiomyocyte progenitors to incorporate into the developing heart. We
      show that these defects are a result of an underlying malformation in the
      formation and polarity of cardiac actin fibers and F-actin deposition. We show
      that these defects can be rescued in culture and in embryos through the
      inhibition of the Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK),
      thus demonstrating a direct relationship between SHP-2(N308D) and ROCK activation
      in the developing heart.

PG  - 1365-71
LID - 10.5665/SLEEP.1280 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of sleep related-eating disorder
      (SRED) and nocturnal smoking (NS) in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy
      (NC). DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS OR
      PARTICIPANTS: 65 consecutive adult NC patients (33 men; mean age 43.9 +/- 19.2
      years) and 65 age-, sex-, and geographical origin-matched controls.
      INTERVENTIONS: Validated questionnaires were used to investigate SRED, NS,
      restless legs syndrome (RLS), and psychopathological traits (using Eating
      Disorder Inventory-2 [EDI-2]; Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [MOCI]; and
      Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: NC patients showed a 
      higher prevalence of SRED (32% vs 3%, P=0.00001), NS (21% vs 0%, P=0.00006), and 
      RLS (18% vs 5%, P=0.013) than controls. Moreover, NC patients presented more
      frequently with an eating-related pathological profile on the EDI-2 (80% vs 46%, 
      P=0.00006) and had a higher prevalence of depressed mood on the BDI (41% vs 18%, 
      P=0.004). In comparison to patients without SRED, NC patients with SRED were more
      frequently women (71% vs 39%, P=0.013), had higher "bulimic" (29% vs 2%, P=0.004)
      and "social insecurity" (48% vs 18%, P=0.013) traits on the EDI-2, had higher
      obsessive-compulsiveness on the MOCI (29% vs 4%, P = 0.009), and were more
      depressed on the BDI (67% vs 29%, P=0.005). NC patients with NS showed more
      frequent pathological profiles on the EDI-2 (100% vs 75%, P=0.035), including the
      "bulimic" (29% vs 6%, P=0.015), "perfectionism" (43% vs 14%, P=0.016), and
      "social insecurity" (50% vs 22, P=0.035) profiles. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a 
      strong association of the compulsive nocturnal behaviors SRED and NS with adult
      NC.

AB  - Pectus carinatum or keel chest is a spectrum of progressive inborn anomalies of
      the anterior chest wall, named after the keel (carina) of ancient Roman ships. It
      defines a wide spectrum of inborn protrusion anomalies of the sternum and/or the 
      adjacent costal cartilages. Pectus carinatum is often associated with various
      conditions, notably Marfan disease, homocystinuria, prune belly, Morquio
      syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, Noonan syndrome, and mitral valve prolapse.
      Treatment of pectus carinatum by nonsurgical methods such as exercise and casting
      has not been worthwhile, whereas surgical management is simple and successful.

TI  - Cushing's syndrome and nocardiosis associated with a pulmonary carcinoid tumor:
      report of a case and review of the literature.
PG  - 359-62
LID - 10.1002/dc.21428 [doi]
AB  - Ectopic hormone production is an uncommon complication of neoplastic lung
      disease. Rarely, patients may present with signs and symptoms of systemic
      endocrine dysfunction related to a hormone-secreting tumor. Bronchopulmonary
      carcinoids are the most common neoplasm implicated in ectopic ACTH-dependent
      Cushing's syndrome. Persistent hypercortisolism, such as that which occurs in
      Cushing's syndrome, causes immunosuppression and makes patients vulnerable to
      opportunistic infections. We present a case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with
      ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome which was originally thought to stem from a
      pituitary lesion as interpreted on magnetic resonance imaging. Her symptoms
      persisted after undergoing hypophysectomy, and further work-up involving a fine
      needle aspiration of the left lung revealed an ACTH-producing carcinoid tumor.
      Before treatment could be administered, the patient developed several new
      suspicious nodules in the left lung that were shown by fine needle aspiration to 
      be infectious in nature. A Gram stain revealed numerous Gram positive branching
      organisms, and culture of the specimen grew Nocardia asteroides. Her pulmonary
      infection was treated with antibiotics and she underwent successful ablation of
      the carcinoid tumor.

TI  - Melatonin treatment for insomnia in pediatric patients with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 185-91
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M365 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of melatonin for the treatment of 
      insomnia in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1948-August 2009),
      EMBASE (1950-August 2009), and Scopus (1960-August 2009) using the terms
      melatonin, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pediatric, insomnia, 
      sleep disorder, and sleep. In addition, reference citations from publications
      identified were reviewed for relevant information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA
      EXTRACTION: All English-language articles and human studies were identified and
      evaluated. Results from all identified randomized trials (n = 5), safety studies 
      (n = 1), long-term follow-up studies (n = 1), post hoc retrospective analyses (n 
      = 1), meta-analyses (n = 2), review articles (n = 9), and letters (n = 1) were
      summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pediatric insomnia is prevalent in children with ADHD
      and impacts academic performance, social functioning, overall health, and family 
      life. First-line therapy includes ruling out differential diagnoses, optimizing
      ADHD stimulant treatment, and initiating good sleep hygiene and behavioral
      therapy. Adjuvant pharmacotherapy is then an option and melatonin is often
      prescribed. Melatonin regulates circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as
      sleep-onset insomnia (SOI) in children with ADHD. Four studies in children with
      ADHD and insomnia showed improvement in sleep onset and sleep latency. Studies
      included children 6-14 years old and melatonin doses ranged from 3 to 6 mg
      administered within a few hours of a scheduled bedtime. In all studies, adverse
      events were transient and mild. The available melatonin studies are limited by
      small size and short duration; variable SOI criteria, ADHD criteria, and
      treatment assessments; and lack of generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Available data 
      suggest that melatonin is a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment option for
      pediatric patients with chronic SOI and ADHD. Regulated melatonin products and
      larger, well-designed trials to establish optimal dosing regimens and long-term
      safety are needed.

TI  - Sleep-wake functioning along the cancer continuum: focus group results from the
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS((R))).
PG  - 1086-93
LID - 10.1002/pon.1664 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cancer and its treatments disturb sleep-wake functioning; however,
      there is little information available on the characteristics and consequences of 
      sleep problems associated with cancer. As part of an effort to improve
      measurement of sleep-wake functioning, we explored the scope of difficulties with
      sleep in a diverse group of patients diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: We conducted
      10 focus groups with patients recruited from the Duke University tumor registry
      and oncology/hematology clinics. Separate groups were held with patients
      scheduled to begin or currently undergoing treatment for breast, prostate, lung, 
      colorectal, hematological, and other cancer types and with patients who were in
      posttreatment follow-up. The content of the focus group discussions was
      transcribed and analyzed for major themes by independent coders. RESULTS:
      Participants not only reported causes of sleep disturbance common in other
      populations, such as pain and restless legs, but they also reported causes that
      may be unique to cancer populations, including abnormal dreams, anxiety about
      cancer diagnosis and recurrence, night sweats, and problems with sleep
      positioning. Many participants felt that sleep problems reduced their
      productivity, concentration, social interactions, and overall quality of life.
      Many also shared beliefs about the increased importance of sleep when fighting
      cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the need for interventions that
      minimize the negative impact of cancer and its treatments on sleep. This study
      will inform efforts now underway to develop a patient-reported measure of
      sleep-wake functioning that reflects the breadth of concepts considered important
      by patients with cancer.

TI  - Multiple sleep latency measures in narcolepsy and behaviourally induced
      insufficient sleep syndrome.
PG  - 1146-50
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.03.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short mean latencies to the first epoch of non-rapid eye movement
      sleep stage 1 (NREM1) and the presence of >or= 2 sleep onset REM (SOREM) periods 
      on multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) occur in both narcolepsy-cataplexy (NC) and
      behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (BIISS). It is not known
      whether specific MSLT findings help differentiate the two disorders. METHODS: We 
      analyzed MSLT data including sleep latencies to and between different sleep
      stages of 60 age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched subjects
      (hypocretin-deficient NC, actigraphy-confirmed BIISS, healthy controls: each 20).
      RESULTS: Mean latency (in minutes) to NREM1 sleep was significantly shorter in NC
      (1.8+/-1.5) than in BIISS (4.7+/-2.1, p<0.001) and controls (11.4+/-3.3,
      p<0.001). Mean latency to NREM2 sleep was similar in NC (8.6+/-4.7) and BIISS
      (8.1+/-2.7, p=0.64); latency to either NREM2 or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
      (i.e., the sum of the sleep latency to NREM1 and the duration of the first NREM1 
      sleep sequence), however, was shorter in NC (4.4+/-2.9) than in BIISS (7.9+/-3.5,
      p<0.001). Referring to all naps with SOREM periods, the sequence NREM1-REM-NREM2 
      was more common (71%) in NC than in BIISS (15%, p<0.001), reflecting the shorter 
      latency from NREM1 to NREM2 in BIISS (3.7+/-2.5) than in NC (6.1+/-5.9, p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that both sleepiness (as measured by NREM1 sleep
      latency) and REM sleep propensity are higher in NC than in BIISS. Furthermore,
      our finding of frequent REM sleep prior to NREM2 sleep in NC is in line with the 
      recent assumption of an insufficient NREM sleep intensity in NC. Together with
      detailed clinical interviews, sleep logs, actigraphy, and nocturnal
      polysomnography, mean sleep latencies to NREM1 <or= 2.5 min, the presence of
      multiple SOREM periods, and the sequence NREM1-REM-NREM2 may be the best MSLT
      measures to discriminate NC from BIISS.

TI  - Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 is required for an LXR agonist to raise plasma HDL
      cholesterol in mice.
PG  - 448-54
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.160465 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Activation of liver x receptor (LXR) raises plasma HDL-cholesterol
      (HDL-C) in mice. Interestingly, the LXR agonist GW3965 fails to raise plasma
      HDL-C in mice lacking intestinal ABCA1, indicating that intestinal ABCA1 plays a 
      predominant role in GW3965-mediated HDL production. How this is coupled to
      intestinal function remains elusive. Because cholesterol is essential for HDL
      assembly and directly regulates intestinal ABCA1 expression via activating LXR,
      we hypothesized that cholesterol absorption, a major function of intestine,
      modulates LXR-dependent HDL formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice lacking
      Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) (L1-KO mice), a gene that is essential for
      cholesterol absorption, were treated with LXR agonist T0901317 for 7 days.
      Intriguingly, this treatment failed to significantly raise plasma HDL-C but
      caused a much greater fecal cholesterol excretion in L1-KO mice. The intestinal
      ABCA1 mRNA level was about 4-fold lower in L1-KO versus wild-type mice, and
      increased 3.9-fold and 8.8-fold after T0901317 treatment in wild-type and L1-KO
      mice, respectively. Hepatic ABCA1 failed to respond to T0901317 in mice of both
      genotypes, although hepatic mRNAs for many LXR target genes were higher in the
      T0901317-treated versus untreated wild-type animals. CONCLUSIONS: NPC1L1 is
      required for an LXR agonist to increase plasma HDL-C in mice.

TI  - SHP-2 is required for the maintenance of cardiac progenitors.
PG  - 4119-30
AB  - The isolation and culturing of cardiac progenitor cells has demonstrated that
      growth factor signaling is required to maintain cardiac cell survival and
      proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate in Xenopus that SHP-2 activity is
      required for the maintenance of cardiac precursors in vivo. In the absence of
      SHP-2 signaling, cardiac progenitor cells downregulate genes associated with
      early heart development and fail to initiate cardiac differentiation. We further 
      show that this requirement for SHP-2 is restricted to cardiac precursor cells
      undergoing active proliferation. By demonstrating that SHP-2 is phosphorylated on
      Y542/Y580 and that it binds to FRS-2, we place SHP-2 in the FGF pathway during
      early embryonic heart development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of
      FGF signaling mimics the cellular and biochemical effects of SHP-2 inhibition and
      that these effects can be rescued by constitutively
      active/Noonan-syndrome-associated forms of SHP-2. Collectively, these results
      show that SHP-2 functions within the FGF/MAPK pathway to maintain survival of
      proliferating populations of cardiac progenitor cells.

TI  - Anesthetic management in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome, mastocytosis, 
      and von Willebrand disease: a case report.
PG  - 261-4
AB  - This case report describes anesthetic considerations for a 6-year-old boy,
      admitted for adenoidectomy under general anesthesia, who had a complicated
      medical history, including mastocytosis, Noonan syndrome, and von Willebrand
      disease. Each affected the anesthetic plan and was addressed preoperatively among
      all surgical and anesthesia providers. Mastocytosis created a major concern, with
      its increased numbers of histamine-filled mast cells. Each drug that was added or
      eliminated from the anesthetic plan, to prevent histamine release by the
      activation of triggers, was considered. Patient handling and temperature control 
      were also concerns. One of Noonan syndrome's characteristics is heart anomalies. 
      This patient had a history of a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary stenosis;
      therefore, air was carefully removed from all intravenous lines and syringes. The
      main concern for bleeding difficulties was attributed to the history of von
      Willebrand disease, which results in prolonged bleeding time and can lead to
      delayed bleeding or serious postsurgical hemorrhage. Desmopressin was
      administered preoperatively to increase platelet aggregation and the von
      Willebrand factor level. The use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs was avoided. We discuss the clinical and anesthetic
      management of this case with a review of pertinent literature.

PG  - 177-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review clinical and radiologic
      manifestations of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSION:
      Common and well-recognized patterns of infection include cavitary and
      bronchiectatic disease and infection in AIDS patients. Less common or
      well-recognized manifestations include nodules or masses mimicking malignancy,
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and others. Definitive diagnosis can be difficult
      and patterns may overlap. Timely diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and
      knowledge of the spectrum of clinical and radiologic features.

TI  - Misassembled mutant DeltaF508 CFTR in the distal secretory pathway alters
      cellular lipid trafficking.
PG  - 447-55
AB  - Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a single codon deletion (DeltaF508) 
      in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) that impairs assembly of the multidomain glycoprotein. The mutant protein 
      escapes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control at low temperature, but is
      rapidly cleared from the distal secretory pathway and degraded in lysosomes. CF
      cells accumulate free cholesterol similar to Niemann-Pick disease type C cells.
      We show that this lipid alteration is caused by the presence of misassembled
      mutant CFTR proteins, including DeltaF508, in the distal secretory pathway rather
      than the absence of functional CFTR. By contrast, cholesterol distribution is not
      changed by either D572N CFTR, which does not mature even at low temperature, or
      G551D, which is processed normally but is inactive. On expression of the
      DeltaF508 mutant, cholesterol and glycosphingolipids accumulate in punctate
      endosomal structures and cholesterol esters are reduced, indicating a block in
      the translocation of cholesterol to the ER for esterification. This is overcome
      by Rab9 overexpression, resulting in clearance of accumulating intracellular
      cholesterol. Similar but less pronounced alterations in intracellular cholesterol
      distribution are observed on expression of a temperature-rescued mutant variant
      of the related ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein multidrug resistance-associated
      protein 1 (MRP1). Thus, on escape from ER quality control, misassembled mutants
      of CFTR and MRP1 impair lipid homeostasis in endocytic compartments.

TI  - Evaluation and management of patients with pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial
      infections.
PG  - 981-93
AB  - Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging pathogens increasingly associated 
      with chronic pulmonary disease. NTM are environmental saprophytes found in soil, 
      dust and water and, unlike Mycobacterium tuberculosis, NTM are not transmitted
      from person to person. Pulmonary disease caused by NTM is a particular problem in
      older people without underlying immune compromise. The diagnosis of NTM pulmonary
      disease usually requires either multiple respiratory cultures that grow NTM or
      heavy growth of NTM from a single bronchoscopy or lung-biopsy specimen. High
      resolution computed tomography is the most useful radiographic study for
      diagnosis and to determine the extent of disease. Treatment includes multiple
      medications with activity against the particular NTM species, as single-drug
      therapy is likely to select for resistant organisms. Data demonstrating the
      effectiveness of specific drug regimens for NTM pulmonary disease are limited.
      Clarithromycin and azithromycin form the backbone of most treatment regimens
      because these drugs are active against many NTM species. Drug tolerability and
      cost are the major barriers to successful treatment of NTM pulmonary disease.
      Adjunctive therapies, including mucus clearance techniques and appetite
      stimulants, are unproven but may be of value in management of NTM pulmonary
      disease. Multicenter, randomized trials of macrolide-based therapies are sorely
      needed to determine the safest and most effective treatments for NTM pulmonary
      disease.

TI  - Invasive fungal sinusitis caused by Pseudallescheria boydii: case report and
      literature review.
PG  - 729-37
AB  - Fungal sinusitis secondary to Pseudallescheria boydii is rare, as only 25 cases
      have been previously reported in the literature. Although Pboydii resembles
      Aspergillus on pathologic examination, it is typically resistant to amphotericin 
      B. Therefore, culture is necessary to differentiate the two. Patients with P
      boydii sinusitis should generally be treated with a combination of surgery and
      antifungal therapy. Combination treatment is particularly important for
      immunocompromised patients with fungal invasion because mortality among these
      patients is high. The prognosis is better for immunocompetent patients, even
      those with fungal invasion. We describe a new case of invasive fungal sinusitis
      secondary to P. boydii infection, and we review the literature on this emerging
      pathogen.

TI  - Expansion of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum in patients with KRAS germline
      mutations.
PG  - 131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) and Costello
      syndrome constitute a group of developmental disorders with an overlapping
      pattern of congenital anomalies. Each of these conditions can be caused by
      germline mutations in key components of the highly conserved Ras-MAPK pathway,
      possibly reflecting a similar pathogenesis underlying the three disorders.
      Germline mutations in KRAS have recently been identified in a small number of
      patients with Noonan syndrome and CFC. METHODS AND RESULTS: 260 patients were
      screened for KRAS mutations by direct sequencing. Overall, we detected KRAS
      mutations in 12 patients, including three known and eight novel sequence
      alterations. All mutations are predicted to cause single amino acid
      substitutions. Remarkably, our cohort of individuals with KRAS mutations showed a
      high clinical variability, ranging from Noonan syndrome to CFC, and also included
      two patients who met the clinical criteria of Costello syndrome. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings reinforce the picture of a clustered distribution of disease associated 
      KRAS germline alterations. We further defined the phenotypic spectrum associated 
      with KRAS missense mutations and provided the first evidence of clinical
      differences in patients with KRAS mutations compared with Noonan syndrome
      affected individuals with heterozygous PTPN11 mutations and CFC patients carrying
      a BRAF, MEK1 or MEK1 alteration, respectively. We speculate that the observed
      phenotypic variability may be related, at least in part, to specific genotypes
      and possibly reflects the central role of K-Ras in a number of different
      signalling pathways.

PG  - 269-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myths are so ingrained into cultural traditions that emotion
      frequently overshadows a rational evaluation of the facts. The reduction in
      resident work hours has resulted in the formation of several myths. The purpose
      of this review is to examine the published data on resident work hours to
      separate out myth from reality. METHODS: An electronic database was searched for 
      publications related to resident training, work-hours, continuity of care, sleep 
      deprivation, quality of life, patient safety, clinical/operative experience,
      faculty work hours, and surgical education. RESULTS: Sleep deprivation has been
      shown to be harmful, and residents played a role in advocating for work-hour
      limits. Surgical residents have seen a less dramatic improvement in quality of
      life compared with other disciplines. Work-hour reductions have decreased
      participation in clinic but have not resulted in a significant decline in
      clinical or operative exposure. Limiting resident work hours will unlikely result
      in a decrease health-care cost. Reduction in resident work hours has not resulted
      in an improvement or deterioration in patient outcome. Reduction of work hours
      has not increased faculty work hours nor made surgery a more attractive career
      choice. CONCLUSIONS: Despite strongly held opinions, resident work-hour reduction
      has resulted in little significant change in lifestyle, clinical exposure,
      patient well-being, faculty work hours, or medical student recruitment.

TI  - Germline missense mutations affecting KRAS Isoform B are associated with a severe
      Noonan syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) is a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, 
      facial dysmorphia, congenital heart disease, and multiple skeletal and
      hematologic defects. NS is an autosomal dominant trait and is genetically
      heterogeneous. Gain of function of SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that
      positively modulates RAS signaling, is observed in nearly 50% of affected
      individuals. Here, we report the identification of heterozygous KRAS gene
      mutations in two subjects exhibiting a severe NS phenotype with features
      overlapping those of cardiofaciocutaneous and Costello syndromes. Both mutations 
      were de novo and affected exon 6, which encodes the C-terminal portion of KRAS
      isoform B but does not contribute to KRAS isoform A. Structural analysis
      indicated that both substitutions (Val152Gly and Asp153Val) perturb the
      conformation of the guanine ring-binding pocket of the protein, predicting an
      increase in the guanine diphosphate/guanine triphosphate (GTP) dissociation rate 
      that would favor GTP binding to the KRASB isoform and bypass the requirement for 
      a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

TI  - Diurnal gene expression patterns of T-type calcium channels and their modulation 
      by ethanol.
PG  - 1365-73
AB  - The transient (T-type) calcium channel participates in the generation of normal
      brain rhythms as well as abnormal rhythms associated with a range of neurological
      disorders. There are three different isoforms of T-type channels and all are
      particularly enriched in the thalamus, which is involved in generating many of
      these rhythms. We report a novel means of T-type channel regulation in the
      thalamus that involves diurnal regulation of gene expression. Using real time
      polymerase chain reaction we detected a diurnal pattern of gene expression for
      all T-type channel transcripts. The peak of gene expression for the CaV3.1
      transcript occurred close to the transition from active to inactive (sleep)
      states, while expression for both CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 peaked near the transition of
      inactive to active phase. We assessed the effect of chronic consumption of
      ethanol on these gene expression patterns by examining thalamic tissues of
      ethanol-consuming cohorts that were housed with the controls, but which received 
      ethanol in the form of a liquid diet. Ethanol consumption resulted in a
      significant shift of peak gene expression of approximately 5 h for CaV3.2 toward 
      the normally active phase of the mice, as well as increasing the overall gene
      expression levels by approximately 1.7-fold. Peak gene expression was
      significantly increased for both CaV3.2 and CaV3.3. Measurements of CaV3.3
      protein expression reflected increases in gene expression due to ethanol. Our
      results illustrate a novel regulatory mechanism for T-type calcium channels that 
      is consistent with their important role in generating thalamocortical sleep
      rhythms, and suggests that alterations in the pattern of gene expression of these
      channels could contribute to the disruption of normal sleep by ethanol.

TI  - Germline KRAS and BRAF mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome.
PG  - 294-6
AB  - Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is characterized by a distinctive facial
      appearance, heart defects and mental retardation. It phenotypically overlaps with
      Noonan and Costello syndrome, which are caused by mutations in PTPN11 and HRAS,
      respectively. In 43 individuals with CFC, we identified two heterozygous KRAS
      mutations in three individuals and eight BRAF mutations in 16 individuals,
      suggesting that dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-ERK pathway is a common molecular
      basis for the three related disorders.

TI  - Epidemiology of DSM-IV insomnia in adolescence: lifetime prevalence, chronicity, 
      and an emergent gender difference.
PG  - e247-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The confluence of sleep/wake cycle and circadian rhythm changes that
      accompany pubertal development and the social and emotional developmental tasks
      of adolescence may create a period of substantial risk for development of
      insomnia. Although poor sleep affects cognitive performance and is associated
      with poor emotional and physical health, epidemiologic studies among adolescents 
      have been limited. In this first epidemiologic study of insomnia defined by
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
      criteria in a US sample of adolescents, we estimated lifetime prevalence of
      insomnia, examined chronicity and onset, and explored the role of pubertal
      development. METHODS: Data come from a random sample of 1014 adolescents who were
      13 to 16 years of age, selected from households in a 400000-member health
      maintenance organization encompassing metropolitan Detroit. Response rate was
      71.2%. The main outcome measured was DSM-IV-defined insomnia. RESULTS: Lifetime
      prevalence of insomnia was 10.7%. A total of 88% of adolescents with a history of
      insomnia reported current insomnia. The median age of onset of insomnia was 11.
      Of those with insomnia, 52.8% had a comorbid psychiatric disorder. In exploratory
      analyses of insomnia and pubertal development, onset of menses was associated
      with a 2.75-fold increased risk for insomnia. There was no difference in risk for
      insomnia among girls before menses onset relative to boys, but a difference
      emerged after menses onset. In contrast, maturational development was not
      associated with insomnia in boys. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia seems to be common and
      chronic among adolescents. The often found gender difference in risk for insomnia
      seems to emerge in association with onset of menses.

TI  - Nocturnal polyuria in women with overactive bladder symptoms and nocturia.
PG  - 1682-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of nocturnal
      polyuria in women complaining of nocturia and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms
      and to identify clinical and health characteristics associated with nocturnal
      polyuria. STUDY DESIGN: Women presenting to a urogynecology clinic with
      complaints of nocturia and OAB symptoms were asked to participate. They completed
      a health characteristic summary, 3-day voiding diary, Nordic sleep questionnaire,
      urinary distress inventory (UDI), and a nocturia distress visual log (NDVL). The 
      24-hour urine production, nighttime urine volume, and maximum bladder capacity
      were calculated from the bladder diary. Nocturnal polyuria was defined as
      production of greater than 33% of the 24-hour urine volume during an 8-hour sleep
      period. A histogram was performed to analyze at what age the prevalence of
      nocturnal polyuria increased. Women were then divided by presence or absence of
      nocturnal polyuria and compared by the health and clinical characteristics.
      RESULTS: Fifty-five women met the qualifications and participated in the study.
      Average age of the cohort was 65.8 +/- 13.5 years. The risk of nocturnal polyuria
      increased with age 65 years or older (prevalence for age 65-74 = 0.86
      [0.62-1.00]) and with white race. On the basis of the mean population values for 
      UDI, NDVL, sleepiness scores, and insomnia scores, all women were bothered by
      their nocturia. Median number of nighttime voids, 24-hour urine production,
      maximum bladder capacity, nocturnal index, UDI, NDVL, sleepiness scores, and
      insomnia scores did not differ, based on presence or absence of nocturnal
      polyuria. CONCLUSION: Among women complaining of nocturia and overactive bladder 
      symptoms, age 65 years or older and white race appear to be risk factors for
      nocturnal polyuria.

TI  - Apoptosis accompanied by up-regulation of TNF-alpha death pathway genes in the
      brain of Niemann-Pick type C disease.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is an autosomal recessive neurovisceral
      storage disease with neurodegeneration caused by mutations in either the NPC-1 or
      NPC-2 gene. The murine ortholog of NPC-1 is mutated in BALB/c npc(nih) and this
      mutant mouse shows equally conspicuous neurodegeneration and loss of neurons.
      However, the molecular mechanisms causing neurodegeneration in NP-C remain
      elusive. Here, we report the presence of apoptotic cells detected by both TUNEL
      staining and electron microscopy in the cerebrum and cerebellum of human patients
      and the mouse model. Moreover, we found that with progression of the disease
      process leading to neuronal cell death, an up-regulation of genes involved in the
      TNF-alpha death pathway caspase-8, FADD, TNFRp55, TRADD, and RIP-by an RNA
      protection assay. Furthermore, RT-PCR showed that TNF-alpha mRNA expression level
      also increased up to 30-50-fold in the cerebellum of 7- and 9-week-old NP-C mice 
      compared with wild-type mice. Elevated expression of TNF-alpha was detected in
      both neurons and astrocytes with TNF-alpha-expressing astrocytes distributed in
      the affected brain regions. Collectively, our results suggest that the cell death
      in the brain of NP-C disease occurs through apoptosis and it is mediated by the
      TNF receptor superfamily pathway.

TI  - Infections due to Scedosporium apiospermum and Scedosporium prolificans in
      transplant recipients: clinical characteristics and impact of antifungal agent
      therapy on outcome.
PG  - 89-99
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unique characteristics, impact of therapy with antifungal agents, and
      outcome of infections with Scedosporium species were assessed in transplant
      recipients. METHODS: The patients comprised a total of 80 transplant recipients
      with Scedosporium infections, including 13 patients from our institutions
      (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [Pittsburgh, PA], University of Maryland
      [Baltimore], Duke University Medical Center [Durham, NC], Emory University
      [Atlanta, GA], and Hospital Gregorio Maranon [Madrid, Spain]) and 67 reported in 
      the literature. The transplant recipients were compared with 190 non-transplant
      recipients with scedosporiosis who were described in the literature. RESULTS:
      Overall, 69% of the infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      recipients and 53% of the infections in organ transplant recipients were
      disseminated. HSCT recipients, compared with organ transplant recipients, were
      more likely to have infections caused by Scedosporium prolificans (P=.045), to
      have an earlier onset of infection (P=.007), to be neutropenic (P<.0001), and to 
      have fungemia (P=.04). Time elapsed from transplantation to Scedosporium
      infection in transplant recipients has increased in recent years (P=.002). The
      mortality rate among transplant recipients with scedosporiosis was 58%. In a
      logistic regression model using amphotericin B as comparison treatment,
      voriconazole was associated with a trend towards better survival (odds ratio
      [OR], 10.40; P=.08). Presence of disseminated infection (OR, 0.20; P=.03)
      predicted lower survival, and receipt of adjunctive surgery as treatment (OR,
      5.52; P=.02) independently predicted a better survival in this model.
      CONCLUSIONS: Scedosporium infections in transplant recipients were associated
      with a high rate of dissemination and a poor outcome overall. The use of newer
      triazole agents warrants consideration as a therapeutic modality for these
      infections.

TI  - Scedosporium species infections and treatments.
PG  - 16-27
AB  - Scedosporium species are now increasingly isolated from immunocompromised and
      immunocompetent patients. Unfortunately, Scedosporium species infections are
      generally resistant to amphotericin B, and S. prolificans strains are
      particularly resistant to presently-available antifungal agents. Here we review
      the microbiology, expanding epidemiology, numerous clinical presentations, and
      diagnostic tools available for Scedosporium species infections. Finally, we
      detail the available in vitro, animal model, and clinical data on the treatment
      of Scedosporium species infections with special emphasis on the role of newer
      antifungal therapies for these recalcitrant infections.

TI  - Sustained efficacy of eszopiclone over 6 months of nightly treatment: results of 
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with chronic
      insomnia.
PG  - 793-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term efficacy of eszopiclone in patients 
      with chronic insomnia. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, multicenter,
      placebo-controlled. SETTING: Out-patient, with monthly visits. PATIENTS: Aged 21 
      to 69 years meeting DSM IV criteria for primary insomnia and reporting less than 
      6.5 hours of sleep per night, and/or a sleep latency of more than 30 minutes each
      night for at least 1 month before screening. INTERVENTIONS: Eszopiclone 3 mg (n =
      593) or placebo (n = 195), nightly for 6 months MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Efficacy was evaluated weekly using an interactive voice-response system.
      Endpoints included sleep latency; total sleep time; number of awakenings; wake
      time after sleep onset; quality of sleep; and next-day ratings of ability to
      function, daytime alertness, and sense of physical well-being. At the first week 
      and each month for the study duration, eszopiclone produced significant and
      sustained improvements in sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of
      awakenings, number of nights awakened per week, total sleep time, and quality of 
      sleep compared with placebo (P < or = 0.003). Monthly ratings of next-day
      function, alertness, and sense of physical well-being were also significantly
      better with the use of eszopiclone than with placebo (P < or = 0.002). There was 
      no evidence of tolerance, and the most common adverse events were unpleasant
      taste and headache. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout 6 months, eszopiclone improved all of
      the components of insomnia as defined by DSM-IV, including patient ratings of
      daytime function. This placebo-controlled study of eszopiclone provides
      compelling evidence that long-term pharmacologic treatment of insomnia is
      efficacious.

TI  - Daytime testing after laboratory or home-based polysomnography: comparisons of
      middle-aged insomnia sufferers and normal sleepers.
PG  - 43-52
AB  - Many studies have shown only modest differences between insomnia sufferers and
      matched, non-complaining normal controls in regard to their levels of daytime
      sleepiness and diurnal performances. The current study was conducted to determine
      whether such daytime comparisons might be affected by the setting (home vs. sleep
      lab) in which study participants sleep on the nights before such testing. The
      study used a counter-balanced, matched-group design in which participants
      underwent three consecutive nocturnal polysomnographs (PSG) conducted either in
      the sleep lab or in their homes prior to undergoing daytime multiple sleep
      latency test (MSLT) and computer-administered performance testing. The study
      participants were 35 (18 women and 17 men) middle-aged (40-59 years)
      non-complaining normal sleepers and 33 middle-aged insomnia sufferers (17 women
      and 16 men) who met structured interview criteria for persistent primary
      insomnia. Use of a hierarchical linear statistical model showed only insomnia
      sufferers who underwent nocturnal home PSG were more alert on the MSLT than were 
      normal sleepers who underwent lab PSG. However, these insomnia sufferers showed a
      greater propensity toward attention lapses on selected reaction time tests than
      did either of the two normal control groups (i.e. either those who slept in the
      lab or those who slept at home). The results suggest the nocturnal sleep setting 
      (home vs. lab) may affect subsequent MSLT and performance test comparisons of
      insomnia sufferers and normal sleepers.

TI  - Reflex seizures and non-ketotic hyperglycemia: an unresolved issue.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Reflex seizures are a rare form of epilepsy, the pathogenesis of which is
      unclear. They have been reported in the setting of non-ketotic hyperglycemia
      (NKH) and are considered to be neuroendocrine in origin. We report a diabetic
      patient with movement-induced seizures whose presentation suggests that brain
      ischemia may be the precipitating event in focal seizures seen in the setting of 
      NKH. We recommend that in such instances a focal lesion such as stroke should be 
      ruled out.

TI  - Intracavitary hematoma simulating mycetoma formation.
PG  - 84-8
AB  - SUMMARY: This case report details the initial radiographic findings of a patient 
      with mixed connective-tissue disease who presented with significant hemoptysis.
      Several radiographic findings suggested mycetoma formation, prompting appropriate
      antibiotic therapy; however, the rapid resolution and subsequent reappearance of 
      the lesion on serial images pointed toward a diagnosis of hemorrhage into a
      preexisting cavity. Chest radiographic and computed tomographic findings commonly
      described as pathognomonic for the diagnosis of mycetoma are, in fact,
      nonspecific and can be simulated by several other entities that result in
      intracavitary masses. Familiarity with these radiographic "mimickers" of mycetoma
      will aid in avoiding misdiagnosis and unnecessary or improper invasive
      interventions when the appropriate clinical history and course of disease are
      appreciated.

TI  - Outcome of lung transplantation in patients with mycetomas.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation has become an acceptable treatment option for
      many end-stage lung diseases. Pulmonary mycetomas are found in patients with
      end-stage lung diseases, especially sarcoidosis. The clinical course and
      long-term outcome of these patients after transplantation remains unknown.
      METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the pathology reports of the explanted lungs
      from all lung and heart-lung transplantations performed at our institution
      between January 20, 1992, and June 26, 2000. Patients were included in our study 
      if mycetomas were present on the specimens. Information on transplant date and
      type, diagnosis, information on antifungal therapy and fungal infections
      pretransplant and posttransplant, and clinical course after transplantation was
      recorded. RESULTS: Mycetomas were present in 3.0% of transplant recipients (9 of 
      303 patients). The underlying pulmonary diagnoses were sarcoidosis (six
      patients), and emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumoconiosis (one 
      patient each). Seven patients received bilateral lung transplants, one patient
      received a heart/lung transplant, and one patient received a single lung
      transplant. Aspergillus was isolated from culture in five patients pretransplant 
      and from five patients posttransplant. Six patients received treatment with
      itraconazole, or IV or inhaled amphotericin B prior to transplantation. All
      patients who survived transplantation received posttransplant antifungal therapy.
      Four patients died in the first month after transplantation. Two patients died at
      17 months and 24 months posttransplant, respectively; one patient received a
      second transplant 30 months later; and two patients are alive and free from
      fungal infections 17 months and 18 months, respectively, after transplantation.
      All of the medium-term survivors received lengthy therapy with inhaled and
      systemic amphotericin B and itraconazole before and after transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant recipients with mycetomas have significantly reduced
      posttransplant survival. Careful selection of patients and aggressive antifungal 
      therapies before and after transplantation have led to improved outcomes in
      patients with mycetomas. Additional research is needed to define the best
      therapeutic strategy for these patients during transplantation.

TI  - Slow-wave sleep and waking cognitive performance II: Findings among middle-aged
      adults with and without insomnia complaints.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - Previous studies showing a relationship between nocturnal slow-wave sleep (SWS)
      and subsequent diurnal performance among young normal sleepers and older insomnia
      sufferers have provided limited support for the notion that this sleep stage
      serves a restorative role for neurocognitive functioning. The current study,
      which examined the relationship between SWS and reaction time performance among
      middle-aged adults with and without insomnia complaints, was conducted to further
      explore this possibility. A sample of 31 noncomplaining middle-aged (ages 40 to
      59 years) normal sleepers and a like-aged sample of 27 insomnia sufferers,
      provided data for the current investigation. All participants underwent nocturnal
      sleep monitoring immediately prior to undergoing a battery of daytime tests that 
      measured simple reaction time, vigilance/signal detection, and complex reaction
      time. Results showed relationships between reaction time performances on some
      tasks and some SWS measures among both the normal sleepers and insomnia
      sufferers. Findings supported our prediction that the presence of sleep pathology
      (e.g., insomnia) alters the SWS-performance relationship observed, but the
      results failed to show a consistent relationship between SWS and subsequent
      performance within either sample. The findings suggest that the specific
      performance demands of the task in question as well as physiological parameters
      other than SWS may determine performance as well. Findings for this and previous 
      studies do provide some support for the contention that the neurocognitive
      restorative value of SWS may change across the lifespan. Possible implications of
      the study's findings are discussed and directions for future research are
      considered.

TI  - Detection of upper airway resistance syndrome using a nasal cannula/pressure
      transducer.
PG  - 1073-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic utility of a nasal cannula/pressure
      transducer (NC), in comparison to thermistor (TH), during routine, clinical
      nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). DESIGN: We analyzed the respiratory arousal
      index (RAI) using TH (RAI-TH) or NC (RAI-NC) in patients with suspected
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SETTING: Sleep disorders center of a
      university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty consecutive, nonselected
      patients referred for evaluation of suspected SDB. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Twenty patients were found to have obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome
      (OSA), 25 had upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), and 5 had primary snoring 
      (PS). Mean RAI-NC was greater than the mean RAI-TH by 25%, 302%, and 500% in OSA,
      UARS, and PS, respectively. RAI-NC was >/= 14 (mean, 25.2) in UARS and < 14
      (mean, 9) in PS. Mean RAI-TH was 8.4 in UARS and 1.8 in PS, with significant
      overlap between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: NC is more sensitive than TH in
      detecting respiratory events during NPSG and may represent a simple, objective
      means to identify UARS among patients with a range of SDB.

TI  - Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection: radiologic manifestations.
PG  - 1487-505
AB  - The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTMB) are a group of bacteria that can infect
      the cervical lymph nodes, skin, soft tissues, and lung. Pulmonary NTMB disease is
      increasing in prevalence and is most commonly caused by Mycobacterium
      avium-intracellulare or M kansasii. Occasionally, M xenopi, M fortuitum, or M
      chelonae also causes pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of pulmonary NTMB infection is 
      often difficult because isolation of the organism from sputum or bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid can represent airway colonization. The radiologic manifestations of 
      pulmonary NTMB infection are protean and include consolidation, cavitation,
      fibrosis, nodules, bronchiectasis, and adenopathy. Pulmonary NTMB infection has
      five distinct clinicoradiologic manifestations: (a) classic infection, (b)
      nonclassic infection, (c) nodules in asymptomatic patients, (d) infection in
      patients with achalasia, and (e) infection in immunocompromised patients.
      Although classic NTMB infection may be indistinguishable from active
      tuberculosis, it is usually more indolent. The radiologic features of nonclassic 
      NTMB infection are characteristic: bronchiectasis and centrilobular nodules
      isolated to or most severe in the lingula and middle lobe. In patients with
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is the most
      common radiographic finding. Knowledge of the full spectrum of clinical and
      radiologic features of pulmonary NTMB infection is important to facilitate
      diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Candidal mycetoma in the neonatal kidney.
PG  - 1126-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the natural history of renal mycetoma (fungal balls) in
      the neonate. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of all neonatal intensive care
      unit patients with systemic candidiasis and sonographic evidence of renal
      mycetoma admitted to the Duke University Medical Center between January 1, 1993, 
      and July 1, 1998. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were reviewed. Three died from
      fungemia, and 3 died from other causes months after completing treatment. Ten
      patients had urine cultures obtained within 1 week of diagnosis; each had a
      positive routine or fungal urine culture for candida. The rate of improvement of 
      renal mycetoma by ultrasound was variable, ranging from 10 days to 4 months and
      was not predictive of survival or long-term renal function. All patients who were
      discharged from the hospital had creatinine </=0.5 mg/dL on discharge. Only 1
      patient had surgical intervention (nephrostomy tube placement). Of the 11
      patients who survived fungemia, 7 were treated for 3 weeks from the time negative
      cultures were obtained, while 4 were treated for 5 weeks or more after negative
      cultures. A declining platelet count was suggestive of fungemia in the patients
      we reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: For our patients with renal mycetoma without complete
      obstruction (patients continued to have urine output) surgical intervention was
      rarely necessary, the rate of sonographic improvement neither correlated with
      clinical course nor necessitated longer therapy, and long-term creatinine levels 
      were normal. Sustained declines in platelet count of 10% per day or more in a
      neonate on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis may be indicative of
      fungemia.

TI  - Prolactin secretion in depressed children.
PG  - 506-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the involvement of the central dopaminergic
      system in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The study of prolactin (PRL)
      secretion may be an informative indirect method for the assessment of the
      dopaminergic system in children with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS:
      Plasma PRL concentrations were measured at 20-min intervals over a 24-hr period
      in 40 pre-pubertal children with MDD, 18 with non-affective psychiatric disorders
      (PC), and 6 normal controls (NC). A subgroup of depressed children (n = 21) was
      restudied after recovery. RESULTS: There was no significant differences in either
      the amount or the pattern of PRL secretion between the MDD, PC, and NC groups.
      Children who recovered from their depression secreted less PRL during sleep and
      more while awake compared to when they were acutely depressed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Overall, there were no differences in baseline PRL secretion between children
      with MDD, NC and psychiatric control. These results suggest that the dopaminergic
      system as measured by baseline PRL blood levels is not compromised in children
      with MDD.

TI  - Sleep EEG studies during early and late partial sleep deprivation in premenstrual
      dysphoric disorder and normal control subjects.
PG  - 127-43
AB  - In this study of 23 patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and 18
      normal comparison (NC) subjects, we examined sleep EEG measures during baseline
      midfollicular (MF) and late luteal (LL) menstrual cycle phases and after early
      sleep deprivation (ESD), in which subjects slept from 03.00 to 07.00 h, and late 
      sleep deprivation (LSD), in which subjects slept from 21.00 to 01.00 h. Each
      sleep deprivation night was followed by a night of recovery sleep (ESD-R, LSD-R) 
      (sleep 22.30-06.30 h) and was administered in the late luteal phase of separate
      menstrual cycles. During baseline studies, sleep EEG measures differed
      significantly by menstrual cycle phase, but not group. Both PMDD and NC groups
      showed longer REM latencies and less REM sleep (minutes and percent) during the
      luteal compared with the follicular menstrual cycle phase. PMDD subjects,
      however, did not show sleep architecture changes similar to those of patients
      with major depressive disorders. Sleep quality was better during recovery nights 
      of sleep in PMDD compared with NC subjects. REM sleep measures changed in
      association with clinical improvement in responders to sleep deprivation. Both
      early and late sleep deprivation may help to correct underlying circadian rhythm 
      disturbances during sleep in PMDD, although differential sleep changes during ESD
      vs. LSD did not correlate with clinical response. Further sleep studies
      addressing additional circadian variables may serve to elucidate mechanisms
      mediating the therapeutic effects of sleep deprivation in PMDD.

TI  - Nutritional and endocrine-metabolic aberrations in women with functional
      hypothalamic amenorrhea.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - The development of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) in weight-stable,
      nonathletic women has long been thought to be psychogenic in origin. This study
      was designed to gain insight into the possibility that nutritional deficits and
      compensatory endocrine-metabolic adaptations contribute to the development and
      maintenance of FHA of the psychogenic type. Nutritional intake, insulin
      sensitivity, and 24-h dynamics of insulin/glucose, cortisol, leptin,
      somatotropic, and LH axes were simultaneously assessed in eight women with FHA
      not associated with exercise or weight loss and in eight age- and body mass
      index-matched regular cycling controls (NC). The percent fat body mass was lower 
      and lean body mass was higher in FHA than in NC (P < 0.05). The FHA subjects
      scored higher (P < 0.05) on two Eating Disorder Inventory subscales and had a
      higher (P < 0.05) Beck depression rating than NC, although all were in the
      subclinical range. Although daily caloric intake did not differ, FHA consumed 50%
      less (P < 0.001) fat, twice (P < 0.05) as much fiber, and more carbohydrate (P < 
      0.05) compared to NC. During the feeding phase of the day, FHA exhibited lower
      glucose (P < 0.05) and insulin (P < 0.01) levels than NC, and the degree of
      hypoinsulinemia was directly related to relative dietary fat (r = 0.73). Although
      24-h mean GH levels did not differ, the pattern of GH release in FHA was
      distinctly altered from that in NC. GH pulse amplitude was blunted, pulse
      frequency was accelerated 40% (P < 0.01), and interpulse GH concentrations were
      elevated 2-fold (P < 0.01) throughout the day for FHA compared to NC. This
      distorted pattern of GH pulses was associated with a 40% decrease (P < 0.01) in
      GH-binding protein levels. Levels of the insulin-dependent insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF)-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) were elevated (P < 0.001) during the
      feeding portion of the day in FHA and were inversely related to insulin (r =
      -0.50) and directly related to cortisol (r = 0.64) levels for FHA and NC groups
      together. Although levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 did not differ, the elevation of
      IGFBP-1 levels in FHA resulted in a reduced (P < 0.01) ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-1,
      which may decrease the bioactivity and hypoglycemic effect of IGF-I.
      Twenty-four-hour mean leptin levels and the diurnal excursion of leptin in FHA
      did not differ from those in NC. LH pulse frequency was slowed 50% (P < 0.001) in
      FHA, with unaltered pulse amplitude, resulting in 45% lower (P < 0.01) 24-h mean 
      LH levels for FHA compared to NC. LH pulse frequency for the two groups was
      related positively to insulin (r = 0.80) levels and the ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-1 (r
      = 0.70) and negatively with cortisol (r = -0.61) and IGFBP-1 (r = -0.72)
      concentrations. In summary, we found evidence of subclinical eating disorders in 
      weight-stable, nonathletic women with FHA accompanied by a severe restriction of 
      dietary fat intake. Unbalanced nutrient intake in psychogenic FHA was associated 
      with multiple endocrine-metabolic alterations. Among these, reduced levels of
      plasma glucose and serum GHBP, a decrease in the ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-1,
      accelerated GH pulse frequency, and elevated interpulse GH levels are indicative 
      of a hypometabolic state. In addition, the magnitude of glucoregulatory responses
      (increased cortisol secretion and decreased insulin/IGF-I action) were directly
      related to the degree of suppression of GnRH/LH pulse frequency. These results
      are remarkably similar to those seen in highly trained athletes with FHA(1).
      Thus, nutritional deficits may represent a common contributing factor to the
      development and maintenance of multiple neuroendocrine-metabolic aberrations
      underlying both psychogenic and exercise-related FHA.

TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for Nocardia infections.
PG  - 711-8
AB  - The optimal therapy for infections due to Nocardia species has not been
      established. To assess the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX),
      we reviewed the records of 19 patients with Nocardia infections seen at Duke
      University Medical Center, Durham, NC, who were treated with this drug, either
      alone or in combination with other antibiotics or a surgical procedure.
      Underlying diseases or therapy causing immunosuppression were present in all but 
      five cases. Sites of involvement were lung (ten of 19), wound (two of 19), and
      brain (two of 19); five of 19 patients had disseminated disease. The mean
      duration of therapy was 7.2 months. Overall cure or improvement was achieved in
      89% (17/19) of cases; 80% of patients with disseminated disease and 60% of those 
      with CNS involvement recovered. This experience, and accumulated clinical
      evidence in the literature, indicates that TMP-SMX should be considered the
      therapeutic drug of choice in infections due to Nocardia species.
