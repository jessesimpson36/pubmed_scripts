TI  - Synergistic role of HSP90alpha and HSP90beta to promote myofibroblast persistence
      in lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of the lung
      parenchyma, causing significant morbidity through worsening dyspnoea and overall 
      functional decline. IPF is characterised by apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts,
      which are a major source for the excessive production of extracellular matrix
      (ECM) overtaking normal lung tissue. We sought to study the role of heat shock
      protein (HSP) isoforms HSP90alpha and HSP90beta, whose distinct roles in lung
      fibrogenesis remain elusive.We determined the level of circulating HSP90alpha in 
      IPF patients (n=31) and age-matched healthy controls (n=9) by ELISA. The release 
      of HSP90alpha and HSP90beta was evaluated in vitro in primary IPF and control
      lung fibroblasts and ex vivo after mechanical stretch on fibrotic lung slices
      from rats receiving adenovector-mediated transforming growth factor-beta1.We
      demonstrate that circulating HSP90alpha is upregulated in IPF patients in
      correlation with disease severity. The release of HSP90alpha is enhanced by the
      increase in mechanical stress of the fibrotic ECM. This increase in extracellular
      HSP90alpha signals through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
      (LRP1) to promote myofibroblast differentiation and persistence. In parallel, we 
      demonstrate that the intracellular form of HSP90beta stabilises LRP1, thus
      amplifying HSP90alpha extracellular action.We believe that the specific
      inhibition of extracellular HSP90alpha is a promising therapeutic strategy to
      reduce pro-fibrotic signalling in IPF.

TI  - Evaluation of an individualized dose titration regimen of patiromer to prevent
      hyperkalaemia in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease.
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12265 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Hyperkalaemia risk precludes optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
      inhibitor use in patients with heart failure (HF), particularly those with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patiromer is a sodium-free, non-absorbed potassium 
      (K(+) )-binding polymer approved for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. In PEARL-HF,
      patiromer 25.2 g (fixed dose) prevented hyperkalaemia in HF patients with or
      without CKD initiating spironolactone. The current study evaluated the
      effectiveness of a lower starting dose of patiromer (16.4 g/day) followed by
      individualized titration in preventing hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia when
      initiating spironolactone. METHODS AND RESULTS: This open-label 8-week study
      enrolled 63 patients with CKD, serum K(+) 4.3-5.1 mEq/L, and chronic HF, who,
      based on investigator opinion, should receive spironolactone. Eligible patients
      started spironolactone 25 mg/day and patiromer 16.8 g/day (divided into two
      doses), with patiromer titrated to maintain serum K(+) 4.0-5.1 mEq/L. Mean
      (standard deviation) serum K(+) was 4.78 (0.51) mEq/L at baseline; weekly values 
      were 4.48-4.70 mEq/L during treatment. Serum K(+) of 3.5-5.5 mEq/L at the end of 
      study treatment (primary endpoint) was achieved by 57 (90.5%) patients; 53
      (84.1%) had serum K(+) 4.0-5.1 mEq/L. One patient (1.6%) developed hypokalaemia, 
      and two patients (3.2%) developed hypomagnesaemia. Spironolactone was increased
      to 50 mg/day in all patients; 43 (68%) patients required one or more patiromer
      dose titration. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 36 (57.1%) patients, with a low 
      rate of discontinuations [four (6.3%) patients]. The most common AE was mild to
      moderate abdominal discomfort [four (6.3%) patients]. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      open-label study, patiromer 16.8 g/day followed by individualized titration
      maintained serum K(+) within the target range in the majority of patients with HF
      and CKD, all of whom were uptitrated to spironolactone 50 mg/day, patiromer was
      well tolerated, with a low incidence of hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia, and
      hypomagnesaemia.

TI  - Early versus late tracheostomy after decompressive craniectomy for stroke.
PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/s40560-017-0269-1 [doi]
AB  - Background: Stroke patients requiring decompressive craniectomy are at high risk 
      of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
      Tracheostomy placement may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.
      Predicting which patients will require tracheostomy and the optimal timing of
      tracheostomy remains a clinical challenge. In this study, the authors compare key
      outcomes after early versus late tracheostomy and develop a useful pre-operative 
      decision-making tool to predict post-operative tracheostomy dependence. Methods: 
      We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected registry data.
      We developed a propensity-weighted decision tree analysis to predict tracheostomy
      requirement using factors present prior to surgical decompression. In addition,
      outcomes include probability functions for intensive care unit length of stay,
      hospital length of stay, and mortality, based on data for early (</= 10 days)
      versus late (> 10 days) tracheostomy. Results: There were 168 surgical
      decompressions performed on patients with acute ischemic or spontaneous
      hemorrhagic stroke between 2010 and 2015. Forty-eight patients (28.5%) required a
      tracheostomy, 35 (20.8%) developed VAP, and 126 (75%) survived hospitalization.
      Mean ICU and hospital length of stay were 15.1 and 25.8 days, respectively. Using
      GCS, SOFA score, and presence of hydrocephalus, our decision tree analysis had
      63% sensitivity and 84% specificity for predicting tracheostomy requirement. The 
      early group had fewer ventilator days (7.3 versus 15.2, p < 0.001) and shorter
      hospital length of stay (28.5 versus 44.4 days, p = 0.014). VAP rates and
      mortality were similar between the two groups. Withdrawal of treatment
      interventions shortly post-operatively confounded mortality outcomes. Conclusion:
      Early tracheostomy shortens duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay
      after surgical decompression for stroke, but it did not impact mortality or VAP
      rates. A decision tree is a practical tool that may be helpful in guiding
      pre-operative decision-making with patients' families.

AB  - The treatment of refractory immune-mediated thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) can be
      challenging. This case report describes treatment of refractory ITP with
      bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. This strategy has been successful in

TI  - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease: An important consideration in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - 203-209
LID - S0954-6111(17)30354-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.rmed.2017.10.015 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare subcategory of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (WHO Group 1). The disease is poorly understood and difficult to
      diagnose; it has no definitive cure to date. These patients present with
      nonspecific symptoms, including dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and weakness.
      Chest x-rays sometimes differ from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and
      may demonstrate alveolar infiltrates and pleural effusions. High resolution
      computed tomography scans reveal ground glass opacities, interlobular septal
      thickening, and lymphadenopathy. Echocardiography can estimate the level of
      pulmonary artery pressures; right heart catheterization is needed for complete
      hemodynamic characterization of these patients. Lung biopsies demonstrate
      remodeling of the venules and small veins with intimal and adventitial fibrosis. 
      This can result in total venous occlusion and subsequent recanalization. Similar 
      changes occur in the small arteries and arterioles but are less pronounced than
      the venous changes. There is no effective medical therapy for these patients, and
      treatment with the pulmonary arterial hypertension specific medications often
      causes acute deterioration with pulmonary edema. The recent discovery of the
      biallelic mutations of the EIF2AK4 gene as an etiology for heritable form of
      pulmonary veno-occlusive disease increases our understanding of the disease
      pathogenesis and potentially identifies a future approach to treatment. Without
      definitive treatment, the prognosis is very poor, and the life expectancy of
      these patients is much shorter than patients with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. These patients need early referral to transplantation centers.

TI  - Pre-operative neutrophil count and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) in
      predicting the histological grade of paediatric brain tumours: a preliminary
      study.
LID - 10.1007/s00701-017-3388-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) is an established
      prognostic marker for renal, lung and colorectal carcinomas and has been
      suggested to be predictive of histological grade and outcome in adult
      intracranial tumours. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a
      correlation of the pre-operative neutrophil count (NC) and NLCR with the final
      histological grade exists in paediatric intracranial tumours. METHODS: A
      retrospective analysis was undertaken at a single centre. Patients less than 18
      years old at the time of surgery who underwent tumour-related procedures from
      2006 to 2015 were included. Patients with recurrent tumours, previous bone marrow
      transplant and metastases were excluded. Pre-operative full blood counts (FBC),
      collected before the diagnosis of intracranial pathology and before
      administration of steroids, were matched with histological diagnosis for each
      patient. Post-operative FBC was also recorded, together with survival data where 
      applicable. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients (74 male, 42 female; mean age, 8 +/-
      0.9 years) with a diagnosis of primary intracranial tumours had pre-operative FBC
      that could be matched to final histological grade. Pre-operative NC and NLCR were
      higher with increasing grade of tumour: grade 1 (NC 4.29 10(9)/l, NLCR 2.26),
      grade 2 (NC 4.59 10(9)/l, NLCR 2.38), grade 3 (NC 5.67 10(9)/l, NLCR 2.72) and
      grade 4 (NC 6.59 10(9)/l, NLCR 3.31). Patients with WHO grade 1 and 2 tumours
      pooled together had a lower NC (4.37 95% CI +/- 0.67 10(9)/l) compared to WHO
      grade 3 and 4 patients (6.41 95% CI +/- 0.99 10(9)/l, p = 0.0013). The NLCR was
      lower in grade 1 and 2 tumours (2.29 +/- 0.59) (compared to grade 3 and 4
      tumours; 3.20 +/- 0.76) but this did not reach significance (p = 0.069). The
      subgroup of patients with pilocytic astrocytoma had a significantly lower NC when
      compared to patients with high-grade tumours (p = 0.005). Medulloblastoma and
      supratentorial PNET subgroups had significantly higher NC compared to the
      low-grade group (p = 0.033, p = 0.002). Post-operative NC was significantly
      higher in the high-grade tumours (p = 0.034), but no difference was observed for 
      NLCR (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: No evidence exists to support the correlation of
      pre-operative NC or NLCR to histological diagnosis in paediatric intracranial
      tumours. Our results indicate that a higher pre-operative NC/NLCR correlates with
      a higher histological grade of tumour. This suggests that immunological
      mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of paediatric brain tumours, and a
      further prospective study is required to substantiate and expand these findings.

PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/09537104.2017.1378807 [doi]
AB  - Bleeding heterogeneity amongst patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is
      poorly understood. Platelets play a role in maintaining endothelial integrity,
      and variable thrombocytopenia-induced endothelial changes may influence bleeding 
      severity. Platelet-derived endothelial stabilizers and markers of endothelial
      integrity in ITP are largely underexplored. We hypothesized that, in a canine ITP
      model, thrombocytopenia would lead to alterations in the endothelial
      ultrastructure and that the Von Willebrand factor (vWF) would serve as a marker
      of endothelial injury associated with thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was
      induced in healthy dogs with an antiplatelet antibody infusion; control dogs
      received an isotype control antibody. Cutaneous biopsies were obtained prior to
      thrombocytopenia induction, at platelet nadir, 24 hours after nadir, and on
      platelet recovery. Cutaneous capillaries were assessed by electron microscopy for
      vessel thickness, the number of pinocytotic vesicles, the number of large
      vacuoles, and the number of gaps between cells. Pinocytotic vesicles are thought 
      to represent an endothelial membrane reserve that can be used for repair of
      damaged endothelial cells. Plasma samples were assessed for vWF. ITP dogs had
      significantly decreased pinocytotic vesicle numbers compared to control dogs (P =
      0.0357) and the increase in plasma vWF from baseline to 24 hours correlated
      directly with the endothelial large vacuole score (R = 0.99103; P < 0.0001). This
      direct correlation between plasma vWF and the number of large vacuoles,
      representing the vesiculo-vacuolar organelle (VVO), a permeability structure,
      suggests that circulating vWF could serve as a biomarker for endothelial
      alterations and potentially a predictor of thrombocytopenic bleeding. Overall,
      our results indicate that endothelial damage occurs in the canine ITP model and
      variability in the degree of endothelial damage may account for differences in
      the bleeding phenotype among patients with ITP.

TI  - In-vivo effects of intraocular and intracranial pressures on the lamina cribrosa 
      microstructure.
PG  - e0188302
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0188302 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing clinical evidence that the eye is not only affected by
      intraocular pressure (IOP), but also by intracranial pressure (ICP). Both
      pressures meet at the optic nerve head of the eye, specifically the lamina
      cribrosa (LC). The LC is a collagenous meshwork through which all retinal
      ganglion cell axons pass on their way to the brain. Distortion of the LC causes a
      biological cascade leading to neuropathy and impaired vision in situations such
      as glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. While the effect of IOP on 
      the LC has been studied extensively, the coupled effects of IOP and ICP on the LC
      remain poorly understood. We investigated in-vivo the effects of IOP and ICP,
      controlled via cannulation of the eye and lateral ventricle in the brain, on the 
      LC microstructure of anesthetized rhesus monkeys eyes using the Bioptigen
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) device (Research Triangle,
      NC). The animals were imaged with their head upright and the rest of their body
      lying prone on a surgical table. The LC was imaged at a variety of IOP/ICP
      combinations, and microstructural parameters, such as the thickness of the LC
      collagenous beams and diameter of the pores were analyzed. LC microstructure was 
      confirmed by histology. We determined that LC microstructure deformed in response
      to both IOP and ICP changes, with significant interaction between the two. These 
      findings emphasize the importance of considering both IOP and ICP when assessing 
      optic nerve health.

TI  - Prognostic Factors and Treatment of Spinal Astrocytomas: A Multi-Institutional
      Cohort Analysis.
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002485 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with spinal astrocytoma
      from multi-institutional data and the literature. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      prognostic factors, treatment, and survival of patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
      DATA: Our current understanding of the epidemiology, prognosis and optimal
      treatment of spinal astrocytoma is limited. The literature is confined to case
      reports or small institutional case series. METHOD: Patient demographics, tumor
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Univariate Kaplan-Meier
      survival analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors followed by
      multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
      performed on pre- and post-operational functional status as measured by McCormick
      score. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients from 4 institutions and 339 patients from
      the literature were included. For the multi-institutional cohort, WHO grade IV
      tumors had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those of lower grades,
      while gross total resection (GTR) (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.14-1.27, p = 0.124)
      trended towards longer PFS when compared to subtotal resection (STR). Age>/=18
      years, paresthesia as a presenting symptom, higher WHO grade were associated with
      shorter overall survival (OS), while thoracic tumor location when compared to
      cervical tumor location, biopsy when compared to STR, and radiotherapy (HR: 0.42,
      95% CI: 0.20-0.88, p = 0.022) were associated with longer OS. For the literature 
      cohort, GTR (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p = 0.005) was associated with longer
      PFS when compared to STR, while higher WHO grade was associated with shorter PFS.
      Higher WHO grade and recurrence/progression were associated with shorter OS.
      Post-operative McCormick score was significantly higher than pre-operative score 
      (p < 0.001), but subgroup analysis of the change in McCormick score by extent of 
      resection revealed no differences among groups (p = 0.551). CONCLUSION: In
      patients with spinal astrocytomas, GTR likely resulted in longer PFS when
      compared to STR. Adjuvant radiotherapy appears to be effective in improving
      survival outcomes for high-grade tumors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Glomerular disease frequencies by race, sex and region: results from the
      International Kidney Biopsy Survey.
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx189 [doi]
AB  - Background: Large-scale studies comparing glomerular disease frequencies across
      continents are lacking. Methods: We surveyed 29 nephropathology laboratories in
      four continents using a standardized data collection form. We obtained recent
      consecutive kidney biopsy diagnosis frequencies at each center and summary
      demographics for each diagnosis. This report focuses on glomerular disease
      frequencies by region and race/ethnicity. Results: Among 42 603 glomerular
      disease diagnoses reported (median age 47 years, 52% male, 57% white), from a
      total of 60 340 diagnoses, glomerular disease subtype frequencies differed
      considerably by continent. Diabetic glomerulosclerosis (GS; 19.1%) and focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; 19.1%) predominated in North America; lupus
      nephritis (38.1%) and FSGS (15.8%) predominated in Latin America; IgA nephropathy
      (IgAN; 22.1%) and FSGS (14.9%) predominated in Europe; and IgAN (39.5%) and lupus
      nephritis (16.8%) predominated in Asia. After stratifying by race, diabetic GS
      (17.4% versus 4.3%, P < 0.001) and FSGS (17.3% versus 11.8%, P < 0.001) were
      more, and lupus nephritis less (15.8% versus 45.6%, P < 0.001), frequent among
      Latinos in North versus Latin America; FSGS was more (13.1% versus 7.1%, P <
      0.001), and IgAN less (27.4% versus 40.5%, P < 0.001), frequent among Asians in
      North America versus Asia; and FSGS (18.9% versus 13.5%, P < 0.001) and diabetic 
      GS (18.7% versus 6.5%, P < 0.001) were more, and IgAN less (14.4% versus 25.4%, P
      < 0.001), frequent among whites in North America versus Europe. Conclusions: We
      determined that glomerular disease frequencies differed by continent, even among 
      patients of similar race/ethnicity. Regional environmental and lifestyle factors,
      and local biopsy policies, might influence glomerular disease epidemiology
      independently of race/ethnicity.

TI  - Leptomeningeal disease: current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 73312-73328
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.20272 [doi]
AB  - Leptomeningeal disease has become increasingly prevalent as novel therapeutic
      interventions extend the survival of cancer patients. Although a majority of
      leptomeningeal spread occurs secondary to breast cancer, lung cancer, and
      melanoma, a wide variety of malignancies have been reported as primary sources.
      Symptoms on presentation are equally diverse, often involving a combination of
      neurological deficits with the possibility of obstructive hydrocephalus.
      Diagnosis is definitively made via cerebrospinal fluid cytology for malignant
      cells, but neuro-imaging with high quality T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      can aid diagnosis and localization. While leptomeningeal disease is still a
      terminal, late-stage complication, a variety of treatment modalities, such as
      intrathecal chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy, have improved median
      survival from 4-6 weeks to 3-6 months. Positive prognosticative factors for
      survival include younger age, high performance scores, and controlled systemic
      disease. In looking to the future, diagnostics that improve early detection and
      chemotherapeutics tailored to the primary malignancy will likely be the most
      significant advances in improving survival.

TI  - A phase 2a randomized controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety,
      tolerability and clinical effect of topically applied Umeclidinium in subjects
      with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.
PG  - 145-151
LID - 10.1111/jdv.14651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperhidrosis is a common medical condition which can have a
      significant impact on quality of life. Umeclidinium (UMEC) is a long-acting
      muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) developed as a dermal formulation. OBJECTIVES: This 
      2-week, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study evaluated systemic
      exposure, safety and tolerability of topically administered UMEC in subjects with
      primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Clinical effect was a secondary objective,
      measured by gravimetry and the hyperhidrosis disease severity scale (HDSS).
      Vehicle was included to evaluate safety. METHODS: Twenty-three subjects were
      randomized to either 1.85% UMEC (N = 18) or vehicle (N = 5) once daily. RESULTS: 
      Measurable plasma concentrations were observed in 78% of subjects after the
      treatment. Nine subjects (50%) on UMEC and two subjects (40%) on vehicle reported
      AEs, most commonly application site reactions. At Day 15, seven subjects (41%) in
      UMEC and two subjects (40%) in vehicle had at least a 50% reduction in sweat
      production. Eight subjects (47%) in UMEC and one subject (20%) in vehicle had at 
      least a two-point reduction in HDSS. No comparisons of treatment arms were
      planned prospectively. CONCLUSIONS: The measurable exposure, acceptable safety
      and preliminary clinical activity observed in this proof-of-concept study suggest
      the potential clinical utility of topical UMEC in subjects with axillary
      hyperhidrosis.

TI  - Lamotrigine-induced sexual dysfunction and non-adherence: case analysis with
      literature review.
PG  - 249-253
LID - 10.1192/bjpo.bp.117.005538 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment maximises therapeutic
      response and minimises adverse effects (AEs). Key to therapeutic AED treatment is
      adherence. Non-adherence is often related to severity of AEs. Frequently,
      patients do not spontaneously report, and clinicians do not specifically query,
      critical AEs that lead to non-adherence, including sexual dysfunction. Sexual
      dysfunction prevalence in patients with epilepsy ranges from 40 to 70%, often
      related to AEDs, epilepsy or mood states. This case reports lamotrigine-induced
      sexual dysfunction leading to periodic non-adherence. AIMS: To report
      lamotrigine-induced sexual dysfunction leading to periodic lamotrigine
      non-adherence in the context of multiple comorbidities and concurrent
      antidepressant and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. METHOD: Case analysis with
      PubMed literature review. RESULTS: A 56-year-old male patient with major
      depression, panic disorder without agoraphobia and post-traumatic stress disorder
      was well-controlled with escitalopram 20 mg bid, mirtazapine 22.5 mg qhs and
      alprazolam 1 mg tid prn. Comorbid conditions included complex partial seizures,
      psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux 
      disease and hydrocephalus with patent ventriculoperitoneal shunt that were
      effectively treated with lamotrigine 100 mg tid, enalapril 20 mg qam and
      lansoprazole 30 mg qam. He acknowledged non-adherence with lamotrigine secondary 
      to sexual dysfunction. With lamotrigine 300 mg total daily dose, he described no 
      libido with impotence/anejaculation/anorgasmia. When off lamotrigine for 48 h, he
      described becoming libidinous with decreased erectile dysfunction but persistent 
      anejaculation/anorgasmia. When off lamotrigine for 72 h to maximise sexual
      functioning, he developed auras. Family confirmed patient's consistent monthly
      non-adherence for 2-3 days during the past year. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction 
      is a key AE leading to AED non-adherence. This case describes dose-dependent
      lamotrigine-induced sexual dysfunction with episodic non-adherence for 12 months.
      Patient/clinician education regarding AED-induced sexual dysfunction is warranted
      as are routine sexual histories to ensure adherence. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: No

AB  - Disturbances of potassium homeostasis can cause either hyperkalemia or
      hypokalemia and result in serious consequences. Although the consequences of
      acute and chronic hyperkalemia and treatment of these conditions in CKD have been
      widely appreciated by nephrologists, more recent information has focused
      attention on the consequences of chronic hypokalemia. Several recent studies have
      documented a "U-shaped" relationship between the serum [K(+)] and higher
      mortality in several clinical studies. The causes of dyskalemias are placed into 
      the unique perspective of patients with CKD and its evolution with progression of
      CKD to later stages and focuses on the pathophysiology of these disorders.
      Emphasis is placed on the high mortality associated with both low and high levels
      of potassium that are unique to patients with CKD. Recent information regarding
      sensors of changes in the serum [K(+)] that evoke changes in NaCl transport in
      the DCT1 and subsequent efferent responses by aldosterone-responsive cells in the
      DCT2 and cortical collecting duct to adjust K(+) secretion by the renal outer
      medullary potassium channel is reviewed in detail. These sensing mechanisms can
      be interrupted by drugs, such as the calcineurin inhibitors to cause both
      hypertension and hyperkalemia in kidney transplant patients, or can be inherited 
      as familial hypertensive hyperkalemia. The role and pathogenesis of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in
      causing hyperkalemia is a common stop point for cessation of these important
      drugs, but, and newer agents to lower the serum [K(+)] that might allow
      continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin receptor blocker
      therapy are examined. Finally, the importance of emphasis on potassium-containing
      foods, such as fresh produce and fruit in the diets of patients with early-stage 
      CKD, is examined as an under-appreciated area requiring more emphasis by
      nephrologists caring for these patients and may be unique to food-challenged
      patients with CKD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated
      complication of heparin anticoagulation therapy resulting in thrombocytopenia
      frequently accompanied by thrombosis. Current evidence suggests that HIT is
      associated with antibodies developed in response to multi-molecular complexes
      formed by platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to heparin or cell surface
      glycosaminoglycans. These antibody complexes activate platelets and monocytes
      typically through FcgammaRIIA receptors increasing the production of PF4,
      inflammatory mediators, tissue factor and thrombin. The influence of underlying
      events in HIT including complex-induced pro-inflammatory cell activation and
      structural determinants leading to local inflammatory responses are not fully
      understood. METHODS: The stoichiometry and complex component requirements were
      determined by incubating fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with
      different concentrations of unfractionated heparin (H), low molecular weight
      heparin (LMWH), PF4- and anti-PF4-H complex antibodies (KKO). Cytokine mRNA or
      protein were measured by qRT-PCR or Meso Scale Discovery technology,
      respectively. Gene expression profile analysis for 594 genes was performed using 
      Nanostring technology and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The data show that antibodies magnify immune responses
      induced in PBMCs by PF4 alone or in complex with heparin or LMWH. We propose that
      following induction of HIT antibodies by heparin-PF4 complexes, binding of the
      antibodies to PF4 is sufficient to induce a local pro-inflammatory response which
      may play a role in the progression of HIT. In vitro assays using PBMCs may be
      useful in characterizing local inflammatory and innate immune responses induced
      by HIT antibodies in the presence of PF4 and different sources of heparins. FDA

AB  - Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited, systemic, metabolic disorder caused 
      by autosomal recessive mutations or a single dominant-negative mutation in the
      gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). The disease is
      associated with a broad range of signs, symptoms, and complications, including
      impaired skeletal mineralization, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism,
      recurrent fractures, pain, respiratory problems, impaired growth and mobility,
      premature tooth loss, developmental delay, and seizures. Asfotase alfa is a
      human, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy that is approved in many countries 
      for the treatment of patients with HPP. To address the unmet need for guidance in
      the monitoring of patients receiving asfotase alfa, an international panel of
      physicians with experience in diagnosing and managing HPP convened in May 2016 to
      discuss treatment monitoring parameters. The panel discussions focused on
      recommendations for assessing and monitoring patients after the decision to treat
      with asfotase alfa had been made and did not include recommendations for whom to 
      treat. Based on the consensus of panel members, this review provides guidance on 
      the monitoring of patients with HPP during treatment with asfotase alfa,
      including recommendations for laboratory, efficacy, and safety assessments and
      the frequency with which these should be performed during the course of
      treatment. Recommended assessments are based on patient age and include regular
      monitoring of biochemistry, skeletal radiographs, respiratory function, growth,
      pain, mobility and motor function, and quality of life. Because of the systemic
      presentation of HPP, a coordinated, multidisciplinary, team-based,
      patient-focused approach is recommended in the management of patients receiving
      asfotase alfa. Monitoring of efficacy and safety outcomes must be tailored to the
      individual patient, depending on medical history, clinical manifestations,
      availability of resources in the clinical setting, and the clinician's
      professional judgment.

TI  - P2Y6 Receptor Activation Promotes Inflammation and Tissue Remodeling in Pulmonary
      Fibrosis.
PG  - 1028
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01028 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with a poor prognosis and very
      few available treatment options. The involvement of the purinergic receptor
      subtypes P2Y2 and P2X7 in fibrotic lung disease has been demonstrated recently.
      In this study, we investigated the role of P2Y6 receptors in the pathogenesis of 
      IPF in humans and in the animal model of bleomycin-induced lung injury. P2Y6R
      expression was upregulated in lung structural cells but not in bronchoalveolar
      lavage (BAL) cells derived from IPF patients as well as in animals following
      bleomycin administration. Furthermore, BAL fluid levels of the P2Y6R agonist
      uridine-5'-diphosphate were elevated in animals with bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Inflammation and fibrosis following bleomycin administration were
      reduced in P2Y6R-deficient compared to wild-type animals confirming the
      pathophysiological relevance of P2Y6R subtypes for fibrotic lung diseases.
      Experiments with bone marrow chimeras revealed the importance of P2Y6R expression
      on lung structural cells for pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Similar effects
      were obtained when animals were treated with the P2Y6R antagonist MRS2578. In
      vitro studies demonstrated that proliferation and secretion of the
      pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic cytokine IL-6 by lung fibroblasts are
      P2Y6R-mediated processes. In summary, our results clearly demonstrate the
      involvement of P2Y6R subtypes in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Thus,
      blocking pulmonary P2Y6 receptors might be a new target for the treatment of IPF.

TI  - Short-cut diagnostic tool in cystinosis: Bone marrow aspiration.
PG  - 1178-1182
LID - 10.1111/ped.13416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is a rare metabolic genetic disorder caused by a mutation 
      in cystinosin lysosomal cystine transporter (CTNS). The diagnosis of nephropathic
      cystinosis (NC) is made by observing corneal cystine crystals and/or measuring
      the cystine content of leukocytes. CTNS mutation analysis confirms the diagnosis 
      of cystinosis, but leukocyte cystine measurement and CTNS analysis have not been 
      widely available, and cystine crystals in the cornea may not be apparent in the
      first months of life. Cystine crystal deposition can be seen in the bone marrow
      earlier than corneal deposition, in patients with NC. METHODS: Ten patients with 
      cystinosis diagnosis were enrolled in the study. Medical records were reviewed
      retrospectively to collect demographic and clinical data such as age at
      diagnosis, disease presentation, parental consanguinity, family history, corneal 
      cystine deposition, leukocyte cystine level, bone marrow cystine deposition,
      presence of renal failure, follow-up time and prognosis. RESULTS: Cystine
      crystals were seen in all of the patients' fresh bone marrow aspiration samples. 
      Eight patients had corneal cystine deposition. Leukocyte cystine measurement
      could have been performed in four patients who had come from another center.
      Complications such as pulmonary hypertension and idiopathic intracranial
      hypertension (IIH) were observed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow
      aspiration might be an easy and short-cut diagnostic tool for NC especially when 
      it is not possible to measure fibroblast cystine content. Additionally some rare 
      complications such as pulmonary hypertension and IIH can be encountered during
      the course of NC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rindopepimut (also known as CDX-110), a vaccine targeting the EGFR
      deletion mutation EGFRvIII, consists of an EGFRvIII-specific peptide conjugated
      to keyhole limpet haemocyanin. In the ACT IV study, we aimed to assess whether or
      not the addition of rindopepimut to standard chemotherapy is able to improve
      survival in patients with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma. METHODS: In this
      randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years and 
      older with glioblastoma from 165 hospitals in 22 countries. Eligible patients had
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma confirmed to express EGFRvIII by central analysis,
      and had undergone maximal surgical resection and completion of standard
      chemoradiation without progression. Patients were stratified by European
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis
      class, MGMT promoter methylation, and geographical region, and randomly assigned 
      (1:1) with a prespecified randomisation sequence (block size of four) to receive 
      rindopepimut (500 mug admixed with 150 mug GM-CSF) or control (100 mug keyhole
      limpet haemocyanin) via monthly intradermal injection until progression or
      intolerance, concurrent with standard oral temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2) for 5 of
      28 days) for 6-12 cycles or longer. Patients, investigators, and the trial funder
      were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in
      patients with minimal residual disease (MRD; enhancing tumour <2 cm(2)
      post-chemoradiation by central review), analysed by modified intention to treat. 
      This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01480479. FINDINGS:
      Between April 12, 2012, and Dec 15, 2014, 745 patients were enrolled (405 with
      MRD, 338 with significant residual disease [SRD], and two unevaluable) and
      randomly assigned to rindopepimut and temozolomide (n=371) or control and
      temozolomide (n=374). The study was terminated for futility after a preplanned
      interim analysis. At final analysis, there was no significant difference in
      overall survival for patients with MRD: median overall survival was 20.1 months
      (95% CI 18.5-22.1) in the rindopepimut group versus 20.0 months (18.1-21.9) in
      the control group (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79-1.30; p=0.93). The most common grade 3-4 
      adverse events for all 369 treated patients in the rindopepimut group versus 372 
      treated patients in the control group were: thrombocytopenia (32 [9%] vs 23
      [6%]), fatigue (six [2%] vs 19 [5%]), brain oedema (eight [2%] vs 11 [3%]),
      seizure (nine [2%] vs eight [2%]), and headache (six [2%] vs ten [3%]). Serious
      adverse events included seizure (18 [5%] vs 22 [6%]) and brain oedema (seven [2%]
      vs 12 [3%]). 16 deaths in the study were caused by adverse events (nine [4%] in
      the rindopepimut group and seven [3%] in the control group), of which one-a
      pulmonary embolism in a 64-year-old male patient after 11 months of treatment-was
      assessed as potentially related to rindopepimut. INTERPRETATION: Rindopepimut did
      not increase survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Combination 
      approaches potentially including rindopepimut might be required to show efficacy 
      of immunotherapy in glioblastoma. FUNDING: Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

TI  - A Tissue Engineered Blood Vessel Model of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome
      Using Human iPSC-derived Smooth Muscle Cells.
PG  - 8168
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-08632-4 [doi]
AB  - Hutchison-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, accelerated aging disorder 
      caused by nuclear accumulation of progerin, an altered form of the Lamin A gene. 
      The primary cause of death is cardiovascular disease at about 14 years. Loss and 
      dysfunction of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the vasculature may cause defects
      associated with HGPS. Due to limitations of 2D cell culture and mouse models,
      there is a need to develop improved models to discover novel therapeutics. To
      address this need, we produced a functional three-dimensional model of HGPS that 
      replicates an arteriole-scale tissue engineered blood vessel (TEBV) using induced
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived SMCs from an HGPS patient. To isolate the
      effect of the HGPS iSMCs, the endothelial layer consisted of human cord
      blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hCB-EPCs) from a separate, healthy
      donor. TEBVs fabricated from HGPS iSMCs and hCB-EPCs show reduced vasoactivity,
      increased medial wall thickness, increased calcification and apoptosis relative
      to TEBVs fabricated from normal iSMCs or primary MSCs. Additionally, treatment of
      HGPS TEBVs with the proposed therapeutic Everolimus, increases HGPS TEBV
      vasoactivity and increases iSMC differentiation in the TEBVs. These results show 
      the ability of this iPSC-derived TEBV to reproduce key features of HGPS and
      respond to drugs.

TI  - Electrolytes: Potassium Disorders.
PG  - 21-28
AB  - Hypokalemia (ie, potassium levels less than 3.5 mEq/L) occurs in fewer than 1% of
      healthy individuals, but is present in up to 20% of hospitalized patients, 40% of
      patients taking diuretics, and 17% of patients with cardiovascular conditions.
      Hypokalemia often is asymptomatic; symptoms are more common in older adults.
      Common symptoms are cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness or pain. Management
      consists of intravenous potassium replacement during cardiac monitoring for
      patients with marked symptoms, echocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, or severe
      hypokalemia (ie, level less than 3.0 mEq/L). Oral replacement is appropriate for 
      asymptomatic patients with less severe hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia (ie, level
      greater than 5.5 mEq/L) also can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle symptoms.
      Urgent management is warranted for patients with potassium levels of 6.5 mEq/L or
      greater, if ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia are present regardless of
      potassium levels, or if severe muscle symptoms occur. Urgent management includes 
      intravenous calcium, intravenous insulin, and inhaled beta agonists. Hemodialysis
      can be used in urgent situations. For patients with less severe hyperkalemia,
      renal elimination drugs sometimes are used, as are gastrointestinal elimination
      drugs. For all patients with hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, drug regimens should be
      reevaluated and, when possible, hypokalemia- or hyperkalemia-causing drugs should
      be discontinued.

AB  - Appropriate growth and synaptic integration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons 
      are essential for functional neural circuits in the brain. Here, we demonstrate
      that disruption of primary cilia function following the selective loss of ciliary
      GTPase Arl13b in interneurons impairs interneuronal morphology and synaptic
      connectivity, leading to altered excitatory/inhibitory activity balance. The
      altered morphology and connectivity of cilia mutant interneurons and the
      functional deficits are rescued by either chemogenetic activation of ciliary
      G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling or the selective induction of Sstr3, 
      a ciliary GPCR, in Arl13b-deficient cilia. Our results thus define a specific
      requirement for primary cilia-mediated GPCR signaling in interneuronal
      connectivity and inhibitory circuit formation.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic Lung Spheroid Cells in a Mismatched Rat Model
      of Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 1905-1916
LID - 10.1002/sctm.16-0374 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating interstitial lung disease
      characterized by the relentless deposition of extracellular matrix causing lung
      distortions and dysfunctions. The prognosis after detection is merely 3-5 years
      and the only two Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs treat the symptoms, 
      not the disease, and have numerous side effects. Stem cell therapy is a promising
      treatment strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. Current animal and clinical studies
      focus on the use of adipose or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. We,
      instead, have established adult lung spheroid cells (LSCs) as an intrinsic source
      of therapeutic lung stem cells. In the present study, we compared the efficacy
      and safety of syngeneic and allogeneic LSCs in immuno-competent rats with
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation in an effort to mitigate fibrosis
      development. We found that infusion of allogeneic LSCs reduces the progression of
      inflammation and fibrotic manifestation and preserves epithelial and endothelial 
      health without eliciting significant immune rejection. Our study sheds light on
      potential future developments of LSCs as an allogeneic cell therapy for humans
      with pulmonary fibrosis. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;9:1905-1916.

TI  - Human lung injury following exposure to humic substances and humic-like
      substances.
LID - 10.1007/s10653-017-0008-5 [doi]
AB  - Among the myriad particles the human respiratory tract is exposed to, a
      significant number are distinctive in that they include humic substances (HS) and
      humic-like substances (HULIS) as organic components. HS are heterogeneous,
      amorphous, organic materials which are ubiquitous occurring in all terrestrial
      and aqueous environments. HULIS are a complex class of organic, macromolecular
      compounds initially extracted from atmospheric aerosol particles which share some
      features with HS including an aromatic, polyacidic nature. As a result of having 
      a variety of oxygen-containing functional groups, both HS and HULIS complex metal
      cations, especially iron. Following particle uptake by cells resident in the
      lung, host iron will be sequestered by HS- and HULIS-containing particles
      initiating pathways of inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. It is proposed that 
      (1) human exposures to HS and HULIS of respirable size (<10 microm diameter) are 
      associated with inflammatory and fibrotic lung disease and (2) following
      retention of particles which include HS and HULIS, the mechanism of cell and
      tissue injury involves complexation of host iron. Human inflammatory and fibrotic
      lung injuries following HS and HULIS exposures may include coal workers'
      pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as
      diseases associated with cigarette smoking and exposures to emission and ambient 
      air pollution particles.

TI  - Rate of bleeding-related episodes in elderly patients with primary immune
      thrombocytopenia: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 209-216
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2017.1360852 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by low platelet counts 
      and a tendency toward increased bleeding and bruising. We aimed to describe
      bleeding frequency and use of rescue ITP therapy to treat or prevent bleeding in 
      elderly ITP patients in a real-world setting. METHODS: Using Medicare 20% sample 
      data, 2007-2012, we identified elderly (ages >/=67 years) Medicare
      fee-for-service enrollees diagnosed with primary ITP between 1 January 2009 and
      30 September 2012. Bleeding-related episodes (BREs) were defined as >/=1 bleeding
      event or use of ITP therapies commonly considered for rescue or emergency
      therapy. BRE rates were examined for the cohort overall, by time since ITP onset,
      and by splenectomy status. Patients were followed from ITP onset until the
      earliest of death, disenrollment from fee-for-service coverage, or 31 December
      2012. RESULTS: We identified 3007 elderly patients diagnosed with primary ITP
      (mean [SD] age: 79.6 [7.5] years; 55% female); 2178 (72%) experienced at least
      one BRE (8867 BREs); 92 (3%) underwent splenectomy. Nearly half of BREs were
      defined by rescue therapy use alone. The overall rate was 1.72 BREs per
      patient-year (95% CI; 1.68-1.75); rates were higher during the first 3 months
      after ITP onset and after splenectomy. CONCLUSION: Elderly ITP patients
      experienced about two BREs per patient-year after ITP onset. Most patients
      experienced at least one BRE. These real-world results demonstrate the importance
      of examining both bleeding and use of rescue or emergency ITP therapy in the
      assessment of disease burden in elderly patients with ITP.

TI  - Adrenergic receptor genotypes influence postoperative outcomes in infants in the

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adrenergic receptor (ADR) genotypes have been associated with adverse
      outcomes in heart failure. Our objective was to evaluate the association of ADR
      genotypes with post-Norwood outcomes in infants with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome (HLHS). METHODS: Infants with HLHS participating in the Pediatric Heart 
      Network Single-Ventricle Reconstruction Trial underwent genotyping for 4
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 3 ADR genes: ADRB1_231A/G, ADRB1_1165G/C,
      ADRB2_5318C/G, and ADRA2A_2790C/T. The association of genotype with freedom from 
      serious adverse events (SAEs) (death, transplant, extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute shunt failure, unplanned
      reoperations, or necrotizing enterocolitis) during 14 months' follow-up was
      assessed with Cox regression and the association with post-Norwood complications 
      was assessed with Poisson regression. Models were adjusted for clinical and
      surgical factors. RESULTS: The study included 351 eligible patients (62% male;
      83% white). The mean age at Norwood procedure was 5.6 +/- 3.6 days. A total of
      152 patients had SAEs during 14-month follow-up including 84 deaths and 10
      transplants. ADRA2A_2790CC genotype had lower SAE-free survival compared with
      CT/TT genotypes during follow-up (Log rank test, P = .02), and this association
      was independent of clinical and surgical risk factors (adjusted Cox regression,
      hazard ratio 1.54 [95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.30] P = .033). Post-Norwood
      complication rate did not differ by genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with HLHS
      harboring ADR genotypes that are associated with greater catecholamine release or
      sensitivity had lower event-free survival after staged palliation. Excess
      catecholamine activation may adversely affect cardiovascular adaptation after the
      Norwood procedure. Future studies should explore whether targeting adrenergic
      activation in those harboring risk genotypes can improve outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The past couple of decades have brought tremendous advances to
      the field of pediatric and adult congenital cardiology. Recent collaborations
      between interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons have sparked novel
      innovative hybrid procedures that provide potentially safer, faster, and less
      invasive alternatives to the management of many diseases. This paper will review 
      the most recent advances in hybrid interventions in the field of pediatric and
      adult congenital cardiology. RECENT FINDINGS: The earliest experiences with
      hybrid interventions included intraoperative stenting of pulmonary arteries and
      perventricular device closure of ventricular septal defects. Newer hybrid
      interventions have focused on a hybrid approach to stage 1 palliation for infants
      with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and hybrid approaches to transcatheter
      pulmonary valve replacement in patients of all ages. Hybrid approaches to complex
      congenital heart disease are important in the management of congenital heart
      disease offering a less invasive approach, and novel hybrid procedures will
      likely be a focus of future research in this field.

TI  - Derivation of therapeutic lung spheroid cells from minimally invasive
      transbronchial pulmonary biopsies.
PG  - 132
LID - 10.1186/s12931-017-0611-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resident stem and progenitor cells have been identified in the lung
      over the last decade, but isolation and culture of these cells remains a
      challenge. Thus, although these lung stem and progenitor cells provide an ideal
      source for stem-cell based therapy, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain the most
      popular cell therapy product for the treatment of lung diseases. Surgical lung
      biopsies can be the tissue source but such procedures carry a high risk of
      mortality. METHODS: In this study we demonstrate that therapeutic lung cells,
      termed "lung spheroid cells" (LSCs) can be generated from minimally invasive
      transbronchial lung biopsies using a three-dimensional culture technique. The
      cells were then characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.
      Angiogenic potential was tested by in-vitro HUVEC tube formation assay. In-vivo
      bio- distribution of LSCs was examined in athymic nude mice after intravenous
      delivery. RESULTS: From one lung biopsy, we are able to derive >50 million LSC
      cells at Passage 2. These cells were characterized by flow cytometry and
      immunohistochemistry and were shown to represent a mixture of lung stem cells and
      supporting cells. When introduced systemically into nude mice, LSCs were retained
      primarily in the lungs for up to 21 days. CONCLUSION: Here, for the first time,
      we demonstrated that direct culture and expansion of human lung progenitor cells 
      from pulmonary tissues, acquired through a minimally invasive biopsy, is possible
      and straightforward with a three-dimensional culture technique. These cells could
      be utilized in long-term expansion of lung progenitor cells and as part of the
      development of cell-based therapies for the treatment of lung diseases such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF).

TI  - Case series: Odontohypophosphatasia or missed diagnosis of childhood/adult-onset 
      hypophosphatasia? - Call for a long-term follow-up of premature loss of primary
      teeth.
PG  - 228-232
LID - 10.1016/j.bonr.2016.08.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypophosphatasia, a metabolic bone disease caused by a
      tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase deficiency, leads to undermineralization 
      of bone and/or teeth, impaired vitamin B6 metabolism, and a spectrum of disease
      presentation. At the mild end of the spectrum, it presents as pathologic
      fractures in later adulthood. Patients with isolated dental manifestations,
      typically presenting as premature loss of primary teeth, are classified as having
      odontohypophosphatasia (odontoHPP). A subset of patients diagnosed with odontoHPP
      in childhood can later develop extra-dental manifestations that constitute
      childhood- or adult-onset hypophosphatasia. CASE REPORTS METHODS/RESULTS:
      Retrospective data related to onset, detailed clinical course, and method of
      diagnosis were collected as part of a natural history of adult patients with
      hypophosphatasia. Of 9 initial patients, all had low serum alkaline phosphatase
      levels for their age and gender at adult presentation (Table 2). The majority
      (8/9) demonstrated childhood dental signs of hypophosphatasia as the initial
      clinical manifestation: premature loss of primary teeth (7/9), absent primary
      teeth (1/9), and delayed loss of primary teeth (1/9). Despite childhood dental
      presentation and/or other signs/symptoms, diagnosis of hypophosphatasia was
      delayed 20-54 years (median = 46) since the primary tooth problems and 8-45 years
      (median = 27) since the first fracture or onset of a major adult tooth problem.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with primary tooth loss in childhood were often diagnosed
      with hypophosphatasia later in life. Pediatric patients classified as having
      odontoHPP under present practice can manifest significant disease burden later in
      life.

AB  - The discovery of new genetic determinants of inherited skin disorders has been
      instrumental to the understanding of epidermal function, differentiation, and
      renewal. Here, we show that mutations in KDSR (3-ketodihydrosphingosine
      reductase), encoding an enzyme in the ceramide synthesis pathway, lead to a
      previously undescribed recessive Mendelian disorder in the progressive symmetric 
      erythrokeratoderma spectrum. This disorder is characterized by severe lesions of 
      thick scaly skin on the face and genitals and thickened, red, and scaly skin on
      the hands and feet. Although exome sequencing revealed several of the KDSR
      mutations, we employed genome sequencing to discover a pathogenic 346 kb
      inversion in multiple probands, and cDNA sequencing and a splicing assay
      established that two mutations, including a recurrent silent third base change,
      cause exon skipping. Immunohistochemistry and yeast complementation studies
      demonstrated that the mutations cause defects in KDSR function. Systemic
      isotretinoin therapy has achieved nearly complete resolution in the two probands 
      in whom it has been applied, consistent with the effects of retinoic acid on
      alternative pathways for ceramide generation.

      single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer statistics are dismal, with a 5-year survival of
      less than 10%, and more than 50% of patients presenting with metastatic disease. 
      Metabolic reprogramming is an emerging hallmark of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      CPI-613 is a novel anticancer agent that selectively targets the altered form of 
      mitochondrial energy metabolism in tumour cells, causing changes in mitochondrial
      enzyme activities and redox status that lead to apoptosis, necrosis, and
      autophagy of tumour cells. We aimed to establish the maximum tolerated dose of
      CPI-613 when used in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy
      (comprising oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil) in patients
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: In this single-centre, open-label,
      dose-escalation phase 1 trial, we recruited adult patients (aged >/=18 years)
      with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the Comprehensive 
      Cancer Center of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (Winston-Salem, NC, USA).
      Patients had good bone marrow, liver and kidney function, and good performance
      status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 0-1). We
      studied CPI-613 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin at 65
      mg/m(2), leucovorin at 400 mg/m(2), irinotecan at 140 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil
      400 mg/m(2) bolus followed by 2400 mg/m(2) over 46 h). We applied a two-stage
      dose-escalation scheme (single patient and traditional 3+3 design). In the
      single-patient stage, one patient was accrued per dose level. The starting dose
      of CPI-613 was 500 mg/m(2) per day; the dose level was then escalated by doubling
      the previous dose if there were no adverse events worse than grade 2 within 4
      weeks attributed as probably or definitely related to CPI-613. The traditional
      3+3 dose-escalation stage was triggered if toxic effects attributed as probably
      or definitely related to CPI-613 were grade 2 or worse. The dose level for
      CPI-613 for the first cohort in the traditional dose-escalation stage was the
      same as that used in the last cohort of the single-patient dose-escalation stage.
      The primary objective was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of CPI-613 (as 
      assessed by dose-limiting toxicities). This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01835041, and is closed to recruitment. FINDINGS:
      Between April 22, 2013, and Jan 8, 2016, we enrolled 20 patients. The maximum
      tolerated dose of CPI-613 was 500 mg/m(2). The median number of treatment cycles 
      given at the maximum tolerated dose was 11 (IQR 4-19). Median follow-up of the 18
      patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose was 378 days (IQR 250-602). Two
      patients enrolled at a higher dose of 1000 mg/m(2), and both had a dose-limiting 
      toxicity. Two unexpected serious adverse events occurred, both for the first
      patient enrolled. Expected serious adverse events were: thrombocytopenia,
      anaemia, and lymphopenia (all for patient number 2; anaemia and lymphopenia were 
      dose-limiting toxicities); hyperglycaemia (in patient number 7); hypokalaemia,
      hypoalbuminaemia, and sepsis (patient number 11); and neutropenia (patient number
      20). No deaths due to adverse events were reported. For the 18 patients given the
      maximum tolerated dose, the most common grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse
      events were hyperglycaemia (ten [55%] patients), hypokalaemia (six [33%]),
      peripheral sensory neuropathy (five [28%]), diarrhoea (five [28%]), and abdominal
      pain (four [22%]). The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse events were
      neutropenia (five [28%] of 18 patients), lymphopenia (five [28%]), anaemia (four 
      [22%], and thrombocytopenia in three [17%]). Sensory neuropathy (all grade 1-3)
      was recorded in 17 (94%) of the 18 patients and was managed with dose
      de-escalation or discontinuation per standard of care. No patients died while on 
      active treatment; 11 study participants died, with cause of death as terminal
      pancreatic cancer. Of the 18 patients given the maximum tolerated dose, 11 (61%) 
      achieved an objective (complete or partial) response. INTERPRETATION: A maximum
      tolerated dose of CPI-613 was established at 500 mg/m(2) when used in combination
      with modified FOLFIRINOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The
      findings of clinical activity will require validation in a phase 2 trial.

AB  - Radiosynthesis and evaluation of [(11)C]GSK1838705A in mice using microPET and
      determination of specificity in human GBM UG87MR cells are described herein. The 
      radioligand was synthesized by reacting desmethyl-GSK1838705A with [(11)C]CH3I
      using GE FX2MeI module in approximately 5% yield (EOS), >95% radiochemical purity
      and a specific activity of 2.5+/-0.5Ci/mumol. MicroPET imaging in mice indicated 
      that [(11)C]GSK1838705A penetrated blood brain barrier (BBB) and showed retention
      of radiotracer in brain. The radioligand exhibited high uptake in U87MG cells
      with >70% specific binding to IGF1R. Our experiments suggest that
      [(11)C]GSK-1838705A can be a potential PET radiotracer for the in vivo
      quantification of IGF1R expression in GBM and other brain tumors.

TI  - Clinical association analysis of ependymomas and pilocytic astrocytomas reveals
      elevated FGFR3 and FGFR1 expression in aggressive ependymomas.
PG  - 310
LID - 10.1186/s12885-017-3274-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are well-known
      proto-oncogenes in several human malignancies and are currently therapeutically
      targeted in clinical trials. Among glioma subtypes, activating FGFR1 alterations 
      have been observed in a subpopulation of pilocytic astrocytomas while FGFR3
      fusions occur in IDH wild-type diffuse gliomas, resulting in high FGFR3 protein
      expression. The purpose of this study was to associate FGFR1 and FGFR3 protein
      levels with clinical features and genetic alterations in ependymoma and pilocytic
      astrocytoma. METHODS: FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression levels were detected in
      ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma tissues using immunohistochemistry. Selected
      cases were further analyzed using targeted sequencing. RESULTS: Expression of
      both FGFR1 and FGFR3 varied within all tumor types. In ependymomas, increased
      FGFR3 or FGFR1 expression was associated with high tumor grade, cerebral
      location, young patient age, and poor prognosis. Moderate-to-strong expression of
      FGFR1 and/or FGFR3 was observed in 76% of cerebral ependymomas. Cases with
      moderate-to-strong expression of both proteins had poor clinical prognosis. In
      pilocytic astrocytomas, moderate-to-strong FGFR3 expression was detected
      predominantly in non-pediatric patients. Targeted sequencing of 12 tumors found
      no protein-altering mutations or fusions in FGFR1 or FGFR3. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated
      FGFR3 and FGFR1 protein expression is common in aggressive ependymomas but likely
      not driven by genetic alterations. Further studies are warranted to evaluate
      whether ependymoma patients with high FGFR3 and/or FGFR1 expression could benefit
      from treatment with FGFR inhibitor based therapeutic approaches currently under
      evaluation in clinical trials.

TI  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 2864-2872
LID - 10.1182/blood-2016-11-709873 [doi]
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune complication of heparin
      therapy caused by antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin.
      Pathogenic antibodies to PF4/heparin bind and activate cellular FcgammaRIIA on
      platelets and monocytes to propagate a hypercoagulable state culminating in
      life-threatening thrombosis. It is now recognized that anti-PF4/heparin
      antibodies develop commonly after heparin exposure, but only a subset of
      sensitized patients progress to life-threatening complications of
      thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Recent scientific developments have clarified
      mechanisms underlying PF4/heparin immunogenicity, disease susceptibility, and
      clinical manifestations of disease. Insights from clinical and laboratory
      findings have also been recently harnessed for disease prevention. This review
      will summarize our current understanding of HIT by reviewing pathogenesis,
      essential clinical and laboratory features, and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of
      athymic complete DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS). METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS
      underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought
      to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center.
      RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having
      thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One
      infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss
      and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5
      to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4
      counts were 44 x 10(6)/L (range, 11-440 x 10(6)/L) and 200 x 10(6)/L (range,
      5-310 x 10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor
      excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and
      4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells). Counts did not usually
      reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing
      infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80
      months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased
      immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7
      of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full
      maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune
      regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in
      7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis settled
      after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune
      problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and
      neutropenia (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that
      thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with
      frequent autoimmune complications in survivors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To present a novel case of ocular argyrosis mimicking conjunctival
      melanoma. METHODS: A 48-year-old man who is a jewelry manufacturer presented with
      raised pigmented lesions in the inferior fornices of both eyes. Brown-black
      colored, follicle-like, masses were observed in both fornices. RESULTS: An
      incisional biopsy confirmed the presence of silver and the diagnosis of ocular
      argyrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its limited negative health effects, ocular
      argyrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival
      pigmented lesions because of the potential for misidentification of neoplastic
      growth.

TI  - Examining a New Method to Studying Velopharyngeal Structures in a Child With
      22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.
PG  - 892-896
LID - 10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0084 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To date, no studies have imaged the velopharynx in children with 22q11.2
      deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) without the use of sedation. Dysmorphology in
      velopharyngeal structures has been shown to have significant negative
      implications on speech among these individuals. This single case study was
      designed to assess the feasibility of a child-friendly magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scanning protocol in this clinically challenging population and to
      determine the utility of this MRI protocol for future work in this area. Method: 
      One 6-year-old White girl diagnosed with 22q11.2 DS was imaged using a
      child-friendly, nonsedated MRI protocol. Quantitative and qualitative measures of
      the velopharyngeal area and associated structures were evaluated, and comparisons
      were made to age-matched control subjects with normal velopharyngeal anatomy.
      Results: MRI data were successfully obtained using the child-friendly scanning
      protocol in the subject in the present study. Quantitative and qualitative
      differences of the levator muscle and associated velopharyngeal structures were
      noted. Using these MRI and structural analyses methods, insights related to
      muscle morphology can be obtained and considered as part of the research and
      clinical examination of children with 22q11.2 DS. Conclusion: The imaging
      protocol described in this study presents an effective means to counteract
      difficulties in imaging young children.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized (129) Xe gas transfer MRI.
PG  - 2415-2428
LID - 10.1002/mp.12264 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperpolarized (129) Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using
      Dixon-based decomposition enables single-breath imaging of (129) Xe in the
      airspaces, interstitial barrier tissues, and red blood cells (RBCs). However,
      methods to quantitatively visualize information from these images of pulmonary
      gas transfer are lacking. Here, we introduce a novel method to transform these
      data into quantitative maps of pulmonary ventilation, and (129) Xe gas transfer
      to barrier and RBC compartments. METHODS: A total of 13 healthy subjects and 12
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) subjects underwent thoracic (1) H MRI and
      hyperpolarized (129) Xe MRI with one-point Dixon decomposition to obtain images
      of (129) Xe in airspaces, barrier and red blood cells (RBCs). (129) Xe images
      were processed into quantitative binning maps of all three compartments using
      thresholds based on the mean and standard deviations of distributions derived
      from the healthy reference cohort. Binning maps were analyzed to derive
      quantitative measures of ventilation, barrier uptake, and RBC transfer. This
      method was also used to illustrate different ventilation and gas transfer
      patterns in a patient with emphysema and one with pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH). RESULTS: In the healthy reference cohort, the mean normalized signals were
      0.51 +/- 0.19 for ventilation, 4.9 +/- 1.5 x 10(-3) for barrier uptake and 2.6
      +/- 1.0 x 10(-3) for RBC (transfer). In IPF patients, ventilation was similarly
      homogenous to healthy subjects, although shifted toward slightly lower values
      (0.43 +/- 0.19). However, mean barrier uptake in IPF patients was nearly 2x
      higher than in healthy subjects, with 47% of voxels classified as high, compared 
      to 3% in healthy controls. Moreover, in IPF, RBC transfer was reduced, mainly in 
      the basal lung with 41% of voxels classified as low. In healthy volunteers, only 
      15% of RBC transfer was classified as low and these voxels were typically in the 
      anterior, gravitationally nondependent lung. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates
      a straightforward means to generate semiquantitative binning maps depicting (129)
      Xe ventilation and gas transfer to barrier and RBC compartments. These initial
      results suggest that the method could be valuable for characterizing both normal 
      physiology and pathophysiology associated with a wide range of pulmonary
      disorders.

TI  - The radiosurgery fractionation quandary: single fraction or hypofractionation?
PG  - ii38-ii49
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/now301 [doi]
AB  - Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), typically administered in a single session, is
      widely employed to safely, efficiently, and effectively treat small intracranial 
      lesions. However, for large lesions or those in close proximity to critical
      structures, it can be difficult to obtain an acceptable balance of tumor control 
      while avoiding damage to normal tissue when single-fraction SRS is utilized.
      Treating a lesion in 2 to 5 fractions of SRS (termed "hypofractionated SRS"
      [HF-SRS]) potentially provides the ability to treat a lesion with a total dose of
      radiation that provides both adequate tumor control and acceptable toxicity.
      Indeed, studies of HF-SRS in large brain metastases, vestibular schwannomas,
      meningiomas, and gliomas suggest that a superior balance of tumor control and
      toxicity is observed compared with single-fraction SRS. Nonetheless, a great deal
      of effort remains to understand radiobiologic mechanisms for HF-SRS driving the
      dose-volume response relationship for tumors and normal tissues and to utilize
      this fundamental knowledge and the results of clinic studies to optimize HF-SRS. 
      In particular, the application of HF-SRS in the setting of immunomodulatory
      cancer therapies offers special challenges and opportunities.

AB  - Large multimolecular complexes of heparin with positively charged proteins such
      as platelet factor 4 (PF4) or protamine can initiate immune responses associated 
      with heparin use in patients, including the most significant adverse event,
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Current evidence suggests that
      platelet-activating antibodies that recognize large multi-molecular complexes
      (300-700kDa) of PF4 bound to heparin cause HIT [1] and in very rare cases
      anti-protamine-heparin antibodies can induce thrombocytopenia [2]. Heparin is
      administered as a mixture of sulfated glycosaminoglycans of variable lengths and 
      sulfation levels. To date the potential impact of chain length, sulfation level
      and impurities on the formation, size and immunogenicity of heparin-protamine
      complexes has not been addressed due to the lack of purified, homogenous heparin 
      chains for testing purposes. Here, a set of well-characterized model heparin
      oligosaccharides was used with protamine sulfate to evaluate the physicochemical 
      properties of the resulting complexes. Hydrodynamic radii and zeta potential
      profiles of heparin-protamine complexes were observed to be dependent upon the
      sulfation location, size and concentration of the model heparin oligosaccharides.
      The well-characterized oligosaccharide-protamine complexes analyzed in this work 
      will be useful for establishing links between heparin-protamine complex
      physiochemical attributes to their potential to illicit cellular immunogenicity.

TI  - Counseling Practices for Fetal Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.
PG  - 946-958
LID - 10.1007/s00246-017-1601-1 [doi]
AB  - While counseling parents of a fetus diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome (HLHS), pediatric cardiologists play a critical role in shaping a
      family's expectations for the months and years to come. However, techniques for
      the most effective counseling practices have not been studied, and significant
      variation among physicians is likely present. Web-based survey of pediatric
      cardiologists that perform fetal echocardiography using snowball sampling. 201
      physicians responded (61% male, 81% from academic centers, and 95% from the
      U.S.), with an average experience of 12 years. The majority of respondents (73%) 
      typically received initial referrals for HLHS between 20 and 24 weeks of
      gestation. Most physicians counsel families alone (54%), while others counsel
      with a nurse (35%), social worker (12%), and/or maternal-fetal medicine colleague
      (15%). Termination of pregnancy was discussed by 79% of respondents, although 15%
      did not know their state's legal limit for termination. While initial counseling 
      sessions routinely described the typical earlier ramifications of HLHS, many
      long-term sequelae of the disease were not commonly discussed. Content of
      counseling was affected by region of the country, but not by practice setting,
      experience, or fetal volume. Respondents identified multiple barriers that
      limited their counseling practices. Our data suggest that current counseling
      practices often fail to cover important information. Perceived barriers to a full
      discourse on long-term sequelae of HLHS are common and may lead to a disconnect
      between reality and a family's understanding of the natural history of palliated 
      HLHS. Opportunities to improve counseling practices exist, and there may be
      benefits to gain from more formal training.

PG  - 135-141
LID - 10.1177/2150135116677253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality through single-ventricle palliation remains high and the
      effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P) is not well understood. We
      investigated current practice patterns in the timing of S2P across two
      professional societies and compared them to actual practice patterns from two
      databases of patients who underwent S2P. METHODS: A ten-question survey was
      distributed to the members of the Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society (CHSS) and
      the European Congenital Heart Surgeons' Association (ECHSA). Results were
      summarized using descriptive statistics. Surgeon-reported preferences were
      compared to clinical data from the CHSS Critical Left Ventricular Outflow Tract
      Obstruction (LVOTO) Registry and the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle
      Reconstruction (SVR) database. RESULTS: Overall, 38% (88 of 232) of surgeons from
      74 institutions responded, of which 70% (62 of 88) were CHSS members and 30% (26 
      of 88) were ECHSA members. Surgeons reported performing S2P at a median of five
      months after stage 1 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.5-6), with no difference
      between CHSS and ECHSA surgeons. Surgeons reported performing nonelective S2P at 
      a median of 4.5 months after stage 1 (IQR: 3.5-5.5), again with no difference by 
      society. No difference existed between the surgeon-reported preferences and
      patient data in the Critical LVOTO and SVR databases for the timing of elective
      (5 vs 5.1 vs 5.3 months, P = .19) or nonelective S2P (4.5 vs 4.6 vs 4.2 months, P
      = .06). CONCLUSION: There was a remarkable lack of variation in surgeon
      preferences regarding the timing of S2P. This may represent a natural
      standardization of practice across congenital heart surgery, which is notable,
      given the current lack of guidelines regarding the timing of S2P.

PG  - 310-312
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000768 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous mastocytosis is defined by the presence of mast cells within the skin
      in the absence of other criteria for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. Mast
      cells are characterized by an abundant granular cytoplasm and a round to oval or 
      spindle-shaped nuclei. The presence of mast cells with bilobed and multilobed
      nuclei in cutaneous mastocytosis is a rare phenomenon and has been rarely
      reported in the literature. To our knowledge, there are only 4 reported cases of 
      cutaneous mastocytosis with atypical mast cells. We hereby report a case of
      urticaria pigmentosa in a 7-year-old female patient. The patient presented with
      asymptomatic skin lesions of several years duration over the neck and left
      scapular area. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of middermal
      perivascular infiltrates mainly composed of mast cells, few lymphocytes, and
      eosinophils. Most mast cells showed pleomorphic nuclei with bilobed and
      multilobed morphology that revealed a positive expression for CD117, tryptase,
      CD68, and Giemsa stains. Based on these findings the diagnosis of urticaria
      pigmentosa with atypical mast cells was made. Additional tests to rule out
      systemic involvement were performed. All values, including a tryptase level, were
      within normal limits. No changes were noted after 1-year follow-up.

LID - 10.1097/COC.0000000000000380 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Postoperative management of anaplastic glioma remains without a clear
      standard of care-in this study we report outcomes for patients treated with
      radiotherapy (RT) with and without temozolomide (TMZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      identified 71 consecutive patients with World Health Organization grade III
      glioma treated with either RT alone or with concurrent TMZ (RT+TMZ), between 2000
      and 2013. Tumor histology was anaplastic astrocytoma in 42 patients, anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma in 25 patients, and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in 4 patients. 
      In total, 26 patients received RT and 45 received RT+TMZ. Adjuvant TMZ was
      administered to 12/26 (46.1%) patients who received RT and 42/45 (93.3%) patients
      who received RT+TMZ. Time-to-event endpoints included progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that
      patients receiving RT+TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ had improved PFS (P=0.04) and 
      OS (P=0.02) as compared with those receiving RT followed by adjuvant TMZ. Cox
      proportional hazards multivariate analysis revealed improved PFS and OS with
      RT+TMZ for all patients (PFS: hazard ratio [HR]=0.42, P=0.02; OS: HR=0.41,
      P=0.03) and for anaplastic astrocytoma patients (PFS: HR=0.35, P=0.03; OS:
      HR=0.26, P=0.01), regardless of whether patients received further adjuvant TMZ.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of RT+TMZ in the postoperative
      management of grade III glioma, and suggest that there is a benefit to concurrent
      RT+TMZ that is independent of adjuvant monthly TMZ. Further investigation is
      warranted, both to prospectively validate the benefit of RT+TMZ, as well as to
      determine if an additional benefit truly exists for adjuvant TMZ following
      concurrent RT+TMZ.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Placement of a right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt to the left or
      right of the neoaorta may influence reinterventions, pulmonary artery
      development, and survival after the Norwood procedure because of differences in
      shunt and pulmonary artery geometry and blood flow. METHODS: We analyzed the
      Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public use dataset.
      Comparisons were made between patients who received a left- or right-sided right 
      ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt during the Norwood procedure in both the overall
      (n = 274) and the propensity score-matched (67 pairs) patient cohorts. RESULTS: A
      left-sided shunt was placed in 168 patients (61%), and a right-sided shunt was
      placed in 106 patients (39%). At the 12-month follow-up, there were no
      differences in pulmonary artery measurements, hemodynamic measurements, or
      pulmonary artery reinterventions between shunt groups. However, the right-sided
      shunt was associated with fewer surgical shunt revisions in both the overall (8.3
      vs 1.9 events per 100 infants, P = .05) and the propensity score-matched (17.9 vs
      0 events per 100 infants, P < .001) patient cohorts. In the propensity
      score-matched cohort only, right-sided shunts were further associated with fewer 
      serious adverse events (84 vs 46 events per 100 infants, P = .01) and improved
      transplantation-free survival at 3 years follow-up (61% [95% confidence interval,
      48-72] vs 80% [95% confidence interval, 69-88], P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: In the
      Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial, right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt
      placement to the right of the neoaorta was associated with fewer shunt revisions 
      and may contribute to improved outcomes in select patients.

TI  - Prospect of rindopepimut in the treatment of glioblastoma.
PG  - 507-513
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2017.1299705 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rindopepimut (CDX-110) is a peptide vaccine that targets epidermal 
      growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a tumor-specific epitope expressed
      in the most common and lethal primary malignant neoplasm of the brain -
      glioblastoma (GBM). Areas covered: The EGFRvIII mutation introduces an 801 base
      pair in-frame deletion of the extracellular domain of the transmembrane tyrosine 
      kinase, resulting in constitutive kinase activity, amplification of cell growth, 
      and inhibition of apoptosis. Rindopepimut contains a 14mer amino acid peptide
      spanning the EGFRvIII mutation site that is conjugated to keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH). The EGFRvIII neoantigen is exclusively present on GBM cells,
      providing rindopepimut tumor-specific activity. The authors review rindopepimut's
      clinical efficacy, administration, safety, and prospects in the treatment of GBM.
      Expert opinion: Rindopepimut showed clinical benefit and significant efficacy in 
      phase II clinical trials, including as part of a multi-immunotherapy approach. A 
      phase III clinical trial was terminated early, however, as it was deemed likely
      the study would fail to meet its primary endpoint. Longer term and sub-group
      analyses will be necessary to better understand rindopepimut's future role in GBM
      therapy.

AB  - Since 2005, the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      (GBM) has consisted of maximal resection followed by radiotherapy plus daily
      temozolomide (TMZ), followed by maintenance TMZ. In patients selected for
      clinical trials, median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
      with this regimen is 15-17 months and 6-7 months, respectively. There have been
      various, largely unsuccessful attempts to improve on this standard of care. With 
      the FDA approval of the tumor-treating fields (TTFields) device, Optune, for
      recurrent GBM (2011), and the more recent EF-14 interim trial results and
      approval for newly diagnosed GBM patients, several questions have arisen. A
      roundtable of experts was convened at the 2015 ASCO meeting to engage in an open 
      conversation and debate of the EF-14 results presented at that meeting and their 
      implications for neuro-oncology practice and clinical research. In October 2015, 
      subsequent to the roundtable discussion, TTFields received FDA approval for newly
      diagnosed GBM.

AB  - Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal-dystrophy (APECED) is a rare
      primary immunodeficiency disorder typically caused by homozygous AIRE gene
      mutation. It is characterized by the association of multiple autoimmune diseases,
      with a classical triad including chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis,
      hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure. Its clinical spectrum has
      significantly enlarged in the last years with the apparence of new entities. One 
      of these novel manifestations is the chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polineuropathy (CIDP), that is characterized by involvement of peripheral nervous
      system, with nerve demyelination, progressive muscular weakness of both arms and 
      legs and sensory loss. The identification of myelin protein zero as an important 
      autoantigen (Ag) in CIDP may suggest the development of Ag-based therapies, such 
      as Ag-specific DNA vaccination or infusion of Ag-coupled cells.

AB  - Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a severe X-linked recessive immune deficiency
      disorder. A scoring system of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome severity (0.5-5)
      distinguishes two phenotypes: X-linked thrombocytopenia and classic
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is curative for
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; however, the use of unrelated umbilical cord blood
      transplantation has seldom been described. We analyzed umbilical cord blood
      transplantation outcomes for 90 patients. The median age at umbilical cord blood 
      transplantation was 1.5 years. Patients were classified according to clinical
      scores [2 (23%), 3 (30%), 4 (23%) and 5 (19%)]. Most patients underwent
      HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood transplantation and myeloablative
      conditioning with anti-thymocyte globulin. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil
      recovery at day 60 was 89% and that of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host
      disease at day 100 was 38%. The use of methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease
      prophylaxis delayed engraftment (P=0.02), but decreased acute graft-versus-host
      disease (P=0.03). At 5 years, overall survival and event-free survival rates were
      75% and 70%, respectively. The estimated 5-year event-free survival rates were
      83%, 73% and 55% for patients with a clinical score of 2, 4-5 and 3,
      respectively. In multivariate analysis, age <2 years at the time of the umbilical
      cord blood transplant and a clinical phenotype of X-linked thrombocytopenia were 
      associated with improved event-free survival. Overall survival tended to be
      better in patients transplanted after 2007 (P=0.09). In conclusion, umbilical
      cord blood transplantation is a good alternative option for young children with
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome lacking an HLA identical stem cell donor.

TI  - Pirfenidone ameliorates murine chronic GVHD through inhibition of macrophage
      infiltration and TGF-beta production.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is hampered by chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), resulting in multiorgan fibrosis and
      diminished function. Fibrosis in lung and skin leads to progressive bronchiolitis
      obliterans (BO) and scleroderma, respectively, for which new treatments are
      needed. We evaluated pirfenidone, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
      drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for its therapeutic effect in cGVHD mouse
      models with distinct pathophysiology. In a full major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC)-mismatched, multiorgan system model with BO, donor T-cell responses that
      support pathogenic antibody production are required for cGVHD development.
      Pirfenidone treatment beginning one month post-transplant restored pulmonary
      function and reversed lung fibrosis, which was associated with reduced macrophage
      infiltration and transforming growth factor-beta production. Pirfenidone dampened
      splenic germinal center B-cell and T-follicular helper cell frequencies that
      collaborate to produce antibody. In both a minor histocompatibility
      antigen-mismatched as well as a MHC-haploidentical model of sclerodermatous
      cGVHD, pirfenidone significantly reduced macrophages in the skin, although
      clinical improvement of scleroderma was only seen in one model. In vitro
      chemotaxis assays demonstrated that pirfenidone impaired macrophage migration to 
      monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as IL-17A, which has been
      linked to cGVHD generation. Taken together, our data suggest that pirfenidone is 
      a potential therapeutic agent to ameliorate fibrosis in cGVHD.

TI  - Presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia in 35 dogs: a retrospective study.
PG  - 307-313
LID - 10.1111/jsap.12636 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary
      immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology
      results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical 
      response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. METHODS:
      Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with
      voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based
      on a neutrophil concentration <1.5x10(9) cells/L on a minimum of two complete
      blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone
      marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated
      neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and
      that had a haematocrit of >/=29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts
      performed after initiation of therapy, were included. RESULTS: Information on 35 
      dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0.5x10(9) cells/L in most cases (21 
      dogs), 0.5 to .99x10(9) cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1.49x10(9) cells/L in three.
      Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49.9x10(9) cells/L) in three.
      [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell
      numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to
      international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and
      Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid
      hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33
      dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within
      one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. CLINICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia
      cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for
      relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of
      immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Lamins are important constituents of the nuclear inner membrane and provide a
      platform for transcription factors and chromatin. Progerin, a C-terminal
      truncated lamin A mutant, causes premature aging termed Hutchinson-Gilford
      Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Oxidative stress appears to be involved in the
      pathogenesis of HGPS, although the mechanistic role of progerin remains elusive. 
      Here we examined whether nuclear lamins are important for a cellular antioxidant 
      mechanism, and whether progerin compromises it. We investigated the activation of
      nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which regulates various antioxidant
      genes including heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), following exposure to sodium arsenite
      or cadmium chloride in lamin knockdown human cell lines and primary HGPS human
      fibroblasts. Knocking down lamin A/C, or B, or all nuclear lamins simultaneously 
      in three human cell lines (HaCaT, SW480, and K562) did not impair arsenite- or
      cadmium-induced activation of Nrf2. Progerin-expressing human primary HGPS
      fibroblasts showed lower basal levels of HMOX1 and NQO1 expression; however, in
      response to arsenic stress both normal and HGPS primary fibroblasts showed Nrf2
      nuclear accumulation along with upregulation and phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 at
      Ser351, downregulation of Keap1, and comparable expression of an array of
      downstream Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. We also observed new forms of
      cleaved lamin A, B1 and B2 induced by cadmium stress although their roles in the 
      Nrf2 antioxidant system need further investigation. These results suggest that
      the nuclear lamins and progerin have marginal roles in the activation of the
      antioxidant Nrf2 response to arsenic and cadmium.

TI  - No evidence for the presence of genetic variants predisposing to psychotic
      disorders on the non-deleted 22q11.2 allele of VCFS patients.
PG  - e1039
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.258 [doi]
AB  - The velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is caused by hemizygous deletions on
      chromosome 22q11.2. The VCFS phenotype is complex and characterized by frequent
      occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms with up to 25-30% of cases suffering from
      psychotic disorders compared with only ~1% in the general population (odds ratio 
      approximately 20-25). This makes the 22q11.2 deletion one of the most prominent
      risk factors for schizophrenia. However, its penetrance for neuropsychiatric
      phenotypes is incomplete suggesting that additional risk factors are required for
      disease development. These additional risk factors could lie anywhere on the
      genome, but by reducing the normal diploid to a haploid state, the 22q11.2
      deletion could result in the unmasking of otherwise recessive alleles or
      functional variants on the non-deleted 22q11.2 allele. To test this hypothesis,
      we captured and sequenced the whole 22q11.2 non-deleted region in 88 VCFS
      patients with (n=40) and without (n=48) psychotic disorders to identify genetic
      variation that could increase the risk for schizophrenia. Single nucleotide
      variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants
      were called and their distributions were compared between the two diagnostic
      groups using variant-, gene- and region-based association tests. None of these
      tests resulted in statistical evidence for the existence of a genetic variation
      in the non-deleted allele that would increase schizophrenia risk in VCFS
      patients. Power analysis showed that our study was able to achieve >80%
      statistical power to detect association of a risk variant with an odd ratio of
      22. However, it is certainly under-powered to detect risk variant of smaller
      effect sizes. Our study did not provide evidence that genetic variants of very
      large effect size located on the non-deleted 22q1.2 allele in VCFS patients
      increase the risk for developing psychotic disorders. Variants with smaller
      effects may be located in the remaining 22q11.2 allele and elsewhere in the
      genome. Therefore, whole exome or even genome sequencing for larger sample size
      would appear to be the next logical steps in the search for the genetic modifiers
      of the 22q11.2-deletion neuropsychiatric phenotype.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine interreader and intrareader repeatability and correlations 
      among measurements of computerized tomography-based anthropomorphic measurements 
      in patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation. METHODS:
      This was an institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study of 23 randomly selected subjects
      (19 male and 4 female; median age = 69 years; range: 66-77 years) with idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis undergoing pulmonary transplantation, who had also undergone
      preoperative thoracoabdominal computerized tomography. Five readers of varying
      imaging experience independently performed the following cross-sectional area
      measurements at the inferior endplate of the L3 vertebral body: right and left
      psoas muscles, right and left paraspinal muscles, total abdominal musculature,
      and visceral and subcutaneous fat. The following measurements were obtained at
      the inferior endplate of T6: right and left paraspinal muscles with and without
      including the trapezius muscles and subcutaneous fat. Three readers repeated all 
      measurements to assess intrareader repeatability. RESULTS: Intrareader
      repeatability was nearly perfect (interclass correlation coefficients = 0.99, P <
      0.001). Interreader agreement was excellent across all 5 readers (interclass
      correlation coefficients: 0.71-0.99, P < 0.001). Coefficients of variance between
      measures ranged from 3.2%-6.8% for abdominal measurements, but were higher for
      thoracic measurements, up to 23.9%. Correlation between total paraspinal and
      total psoas muscle area was strong (r(2) = 0.67, P < 0.001). Thoracic and
      abdominal musculature had a weaker correlation (r(2) = 0.35-0.38, P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Measures of thoracic and abdominal muscle and fat area are highly
      repeatable in patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation.
      Measures of muscle area are strongly correlated among abdominal locations, but
      inversely correlated between abdominal and thoracic locations.

TI  - Upregulation of interleukin-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels in the
      lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/s12890-017-0380-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Innate T helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses mediated by interleukin
      (IL)-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and IL-25 have been shown to play
      an important role in pulmonary fibrosis of animal models; however, their clinical
      implications remain poorly understood. METHODS: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33
      concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from
      normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22),
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). RESULTS: The
      TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to 
      the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p =
      0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and
      sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25
      levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432).
      Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed
      clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706,
      respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC 
      = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/mug TSLP and 3.77
      pg/mug IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 
      and 94.3% accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/mug TSLP and 2.52 pg/mug IL-33
      possessed 99.4 and 93.2% accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other
      interstitial lung disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: Innate immune responses may be
      associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in
      BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial 
      lung diseases.

TI  - Common Skin Conditions in Children: Noninfectious Rashes.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - Cutaneous adverse drug reactions are among the most common noninfectious rashes
      of childhood. Cutaneous adverse drug reactions are classified as morbilliform,
      urticarial, bullous, pustular, or psoriasiform. Atopic dermatitis is one of the
      most common inflammatory cutaneous eruptions, and is characterized by pruritus
      and flexural distribution. Emollients and topical corticosteroids are first-line 
      therapies. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are second-line, steroid-sparing drugs 
      for certain conditions, such as face and eyelid eczema. Systemic and immunologic 
      conditions have mucocutaneous features, such as malar rash, discoid lupus, and
      photosensitivity in systemic lupus erythematosus; lip, oral, and extremity
      changes as well as polymorphous rash in Kawasaki disease; erythematous, scaly
      plaques in psoriasis; and xerosis and face, hand, and leg skin changes in type 1 
      diabetes. Genetic conditions that manifest as changes in skin pigmentation are
      important to recognize because of the thorough diagnostic evaluation they
      warrant, the often challenging interventions they necessitate, and the permanent 
      disability that frequently accompanies them. These conditions include
      neurofibromatosis, LEOPARD syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti, congenital
      hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects syndrome,
      hypomelanosis of Ito, and acanthosis nigricans. Childhood dermatologic
      emergencies often are associated with infection and drugs and require early
      recognition and intervention.

AB  - Immune Thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease associated with bleeding that is
      treated by increasing the platelet count to a level where the chance of
      uncontrollable bleeding is low. Failure occurs when platelet counts are not
      raised sufficiently (initial failure), or when high platelet counts are not
      maintained after initial success (relapse). In this paper, we propose a Bayesian 
      clinical trial design that uses a Markov multistate model along with a power
      prior for the parameters which incorporates historical control data to estimate
      transition rates among two randomized groups as defined by the model. A detailed 
      simulation is carried out to examine the operating characteristics of a trial to 
      test whether a new treatment reduces the relapse rate by 40% relative to standard
      care when data from 60 historical controls treated with standard care is
      available. We also use simulated data to demonstrate effects of discordance
      between historical and randomized controls on the estimated hazard ratios.
      Finally, we use a simulated trial to demonstrate briefly what type of results the
      model can give and how those results can be used to address hypotheses regarding 
      treatment effects. Using simulated data, we show that the model yields good
      operating characteristics when the historical and randomized controls are from
      the same population, and demonstrate how discordance between the control groups
      affects the operating characteristics.

AB  - Engineered neural stem cells (NSCs) are a promising approach to treating
      glioblastoma (GBM). The ideal NSC drug carrier for clinical use should be easily 
      isolated and autologous to avoid immune rejection. We transdifferentiated (TD)
      human fibroblasts into tumor-homing early-stage induced NSCs (h-iNSC(TE)),
      engineered them to express optical reporters and different therapeutic gene
      products, and assessed the tumor-homing migration and therapeutic efficacy of
      cytotoxic h-iNSC(TE) in patient-derived GBM models of surgical and nonsurgical
      disease. Molecular and functional analysis revealed that our single-factor SOX2
      TD strategy converted human skin fibroblasts into h-iNSC(TE) that were nestin(+) 
      and expressed pathways associated with tumor-homing migration in 4 days.
      Time-lapse motion analysis showed that h-iNSC(TE) rapidly migrated to human GBM
      cells and penetrated human GBM spheroids, a process inhibited by blockade of
      CXCR4. Serial imaging showed that h-iNSC(TE) delivery of the proapoptotic agent
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) reduced the
      size of solid human GBM xenografts 250-fold in 3 weeks and prolonged median
      survival from 22 to 49 days. Additionally, h-iNSC(TE) thymidine
      kinase/ganciclovir enzyme/prodrug therapy (h-iNSC(TE)-TK) reduced the size of
      patient-derived GBM xenografts 20-fold and extended survival from 32 to 62 days. 
      Mimicking clinical NSC therapy, h-iNSC(TE)-TK therapy delivered into the
      postoperative surgical resection cavity delayed the regrowth of residual GBMs
      threefold and prolonged survival from 46 to 60 days. These results suggest that
      TD of human skin into h-iNSC(TE) is a platform for creating tumor-homing
      cytotoxic cell therapies for cancer, where the potential to avoid carrier
      rejection could maximize treatment durability in human trials.

TI  - A Defect in NIPAL4 Is Associated with Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis
      in American Bulldogs.
PG  - e0170708
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0170708 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis in the American bulldog is
      characterized by generalized scaling and erythema with adherent scale on the
      glabrous skin. We had previously linked this disorder to NIPAL4, which encodes
      the protein ichthyin. Sequencing of NIPAL4 revealed a homozygous single base
      deletion (CanFam3.1 canine reference genome sequence NC_06586.3 g.52737379del),
      the 157th base (cytosine) in exon 6 of NIPAL4 as the most likely causative
      variant in affected dogs. This frameshift deletion results in a premature stop
      codon producing a truncated and defective NIPAL4 (ichthyin) protein of 248 amino 
      acids instead of the wild-type length of 404. Obligate carriers were confirmed to
      be heterozygous for this variant, and 150 clinically non-affected dogs of other
      breeds were homozygous for the wild-type gene. Among 800 American bulldogs
      tested, 34% of clinically healthy dogs were discovered to be heterozygous for the
      defective allele. More importantly, the development of this canine model of
      autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis will provide insight into the
      development of new treatments across species.

TI  - Genetic Drivers of Kidney Defects in the DiGeorge Syndrome.
PG  - 742-754
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1609009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The DiGeorge syndrome, the most common of the microdeletion
      syndromes, affects multiple organs, including the heart, the nervous system, and 
      the kidney. It is caused by deletions on chromosome 22q11.2; the genetic driver
      of the kidney defects is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a genomewide search for
      structural variants in two cohorts: 2080 patients with congenital kidney and
      urinary tract anomalies and 22,094 controls. We performed exome and targeted
      resequencing in samples obtained from 586 additional patients with congenital
      kidney anomalies. We also carried out functional studies using zebrafish and
      mice. RESULTS: We identified heterozygous deletions of 22q11.2 in 1.1% of the
      patients with congenital kidney anomalies and in 0.01% of population controls
      (odds ratio, 81.5; P=4.5x10(-14)). We localized the main drivers of renal disease
      in the DiGeorge syndrome to a 370-kb region containing nine genes. In zebrafish
      embryos, an induced loss of function in snap29, aifm3, and crkl resulted in renal
      defects; the loss of crkl alone was sufficient to induce defects. Five of 586
      patients with congenital urinary anomalies had newly identified, heterozygous
      protein-altering variants, including a premature termination codon, in CRKL. The 
      inactivation of Crkl in the mouse model induced developmental defects similar to 
      those observed in patients with congenital urinary anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: We
      identified a recurrent 370-kb deletion at the 22q11.2 locus as a driver of kidney
      defects in the DiGeorge syndrome and in sporadic congenital kidney and urinary
      tract anomalies. Of the nine genes at this locus, SNAP29, AIFM3, and CRKL appear 
      to be critical to the phenotype, with haploinsufficiency of CRKL emerging as the 
      main genetic driver. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

TI  - Obstetrical, pregnancy and socio-economic predictors for new-onset severe
      postpartum psychiatric disorders in primiparous women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childbirth is a potent trigger for the onset of psychiatric illness
      in women including postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum psychosis (PP).
      Medical complications occurring during pregnancy and/or childbirth have been
      linked to postpartum psychiatric illness and sociodemographic factors. We
      evaluated if pregnancy and obstetrical predictors have similar effects on
      different types of postpartum psychiatric disorders. METHOD: A population-based
      cohort study using Danish registers was conducted in 392 458 primiparous women
      with a singleton delivery between 1995 and 2012 and no previous psychiatric
      history. The main outcome was first-onset postpartum psychiatric episodes.
      Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for any psychiatric contact in four 
      quarters for the first year postpartum. RESULTS: PPD and postpartum acute stress 
      reactions were associated with pregnancy and obstetrical complications. For PPD, 
      hyperemesis gravidarum [IRR 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-3.73],
      gestational hypertension (IRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.33-2.55), pre-eclampsia (IRR 1.45,
      95% CI 1.14-1.84) and Cesarean section (C-section) (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13-1.53)
      were associated with increased risk. For postpartum acute stress, hyperemesis
      gravidarum (IRR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38-2.71), preterm birth (IRR 1.51, 95% CI
      1.30-1.75), gestational diabetes (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.97) and C-section (IRR 
      1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.55) were associated with increased risk. In contrast, risk of
      PP was not associated with pregnancy or obstetrical complications. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pregnancy and obstetrical complications can increase the risk for PPD and acute
      stress reactions but not PP. Identification of postpartum women requiring
      secondary care is needed to develop targeted approaches for screening and
      treatment. Future work should focus on understanding the contributions of
      psychological stressors and underlying biology on the development of postpartum
      psychiatric illness.

AB  - Silver_nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been reported to inhibit specification of
      erythroid cells and to induce spinal cord deformities and cardiac arrhythmia in
      vertebrates, but have not been implicated in development of neural crest (NC) and
      pigment cells in an in vivo model yet. In current study, down-regulated
      expressions of NC genes pax7 and foxd3, melanophore genes mitfa and dct, and
      xanthophore gene gch2 in AgNPs-exposed embryos were revealed by microarray,
      qRT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). Then, the down-regulated
      expressions of melanophore genes mitfa and dct but not xanthophore gene gch2 in
      AgNPs-exposed embryos were found to be recovered by melanogenesis agonists
      palmitic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP). Finally, Ag(+) chelating and
      AgNPs coating compound l-cysteine was found to neutralize AgNPs-induced
      hypopigmentation in AgNPs-exposed embryos, and to recover the down-regulated
      expressions of both dct and gch2 to nearly normal level in embryos, suggesting
      that AgNPs-releasing Ag(+) might mediate their biological effects on zebrafish
      pigmentation mostly. This study was firstly to unveil that AgNPs might
      specifically act up-stream of mitfa and pax7 genes to suppress specification and 
      differentiation of melanophore and xanthophore lineages respectively by their
      releasing Ag(+) during vertebrate embryogenesis.

TI  - Algorithmic three-dimensional analysis of tumor shape in MRI improves prognosis
      of survival in glioblastoma: a multi-institutional study.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.1007/s11060-016-2359-7 [doi]
AB  - In this retrospective, IRB-exempt study, we analyzed data from 68 patients
      diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) in two institutions and investigated the
      relationship between tumor shape, quantified using algorithmic analysis of
      magnetic resonance images, and survival. Each patient's Fluid Attenuated
      Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) abnormality and enhancing tumor were manually
      delineated, and tumor shape was analyzed by automatic computer algorithms. Five
      features were automatically extracted from the images to quantify the extent of
      irregularity in tumor shape in two and three dimensions. Univariate Cox
      proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to determine how prognostic
      each feature was of survival. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to illustrate
      the prognostic value of each feature. To determine whether the proposed
      quantitative shape features have additional prognostic value compared with
      standard clinical features, we controlled for tumor volume, patient age, and
      Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS). The FLAIR-based bounding ellipsoid volume
      ratio (BEVR), a 3D complexity measure, was strongly prognostic of survival, with 
      a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI 0.20-0.65), and remained significant in regression
      analysis after controlling for other clinical factors (P = 0.0061). Three
      enhancing-tumor based shape features were prognostic of survival independently of
      clinical factors: BEVR (P = 0.0008), margin fluctuation (P = 0.0013), and angular
      standard deviation (P = 0.0078). Algorithmically assessed tumor shape is
      statistically significantly prognostic of survival for patients with GBM
      independently of patient age, KPS, and tumor volume. This shows promise for
      extending the utility of MR imaging in treatment of GBM patients.

TI  - Gene profile of fibroblasts identify relation of CCL8 with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/s12931-016-0493-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the complex
      interaction of cells involved in chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Global gene
      expression of a homogenous cell population will identify novel candidate genes.
      METHODS: Gene expression of fibroblasts derived from lung tissues (8 IPF and 4
      controls) was profiled, and ontology and functional pathway were analyzed in the 
      genes exhibiting >2 absolute fold changes with p-values < 0.05. CCL8 mRNA and
      protein levels were quantified using real-time PCR and ELISA. CCL8 localization
      was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: One hundred seventy eight 
      genes differentially expressed and 15 genes exhibited >10-fold change. Among
      them, 13 were novel in relation with IPF. CCL8 expression was 22.8-fold higher in
      IPF fibroblasts. The levels of CCL8 mRNA and protein were 3 and 9-fold higher in 
      14 IPF fibroblasts than those in 10 control fibroblasts by real-time PCR and
      ELISA (p = 0.022 and p = 0.026, respectively). The CCL8 concentrations in BAL
      fluid was significantly higher in 86 patients with IPF than those in 41 controls,
      and other interstitial lung diseases including non-specific interstitial
      pneumonia (n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (n = 20) and sarcoidosis (n =
      19) (p < 0.005, respectively). Cut-off values of 2.29 pg/mL and 0.43 pg/mL
      possessed 80.2 and 70.7% accuracy for the discrimination of IPF from NC and the
      other lung diseases, respectively. IPF subjects with CCL8 levels >28.61 pg/mL
      showed shorter survival compared to those with lower levels (p = 0.012). CCL8 was
      expressed by alpha-SMA-positive cells in the interstitium of IPF. CONCLUSIONS:
      Transcriptome analysis identified several novel IPF-related genes. Among them,
      CCL8 is a candidate molecule for the differential diagnosis and prediction of
      survival.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain cancer, and all attempts to control it have 
      failed so far. However, the future looks bright, as we now know the molecular
      landscape of GBM through the work of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program. GBMs
      exhibit significant inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, and to control this
      type of tumor, a personalized approach is required. One target, whose gene is
      amplified and mutated in a large number of GBMs, is the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR). But all attempts to target it have been unsuccessful. We
      attribute the reason for this failure to the molecular heterogeneity of EGFR in
      GBM, as well as to the poor brain penetration of previously tested EGFR-Tyrosine 
      Kinase Inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). In this review, we discuss the molecular
      heterogeneity of EGFR and provide rational preclinical and clinical guidelines
      for testing AZD9291, a third generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with both a high
      affinity for EGFRvIII and excellent brain penetration.

TI  - Production and quality control assessment of a GLP-grade immunotoxin,
      D2C7-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL, for a phase I/II clinical trial.
PG  - 2747-2766
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-8063-x [doi]
AB  - D2C7-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL (D2C7-IT) is a novel recombinant Pseudomonas exotoxin
      A-based immunotoxin (IT), targeting both wild-type epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFRwt) and mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) proteins overexpressed
      in glioblastomas. Initial pre-clinical testing demonstrated the anti-tumor
      efficacy of D2C7-IT against orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft models expressing
      EGFRwt, EGFRvIII, or both EGFRwt and EGFRvIII. A good laboratory practice (GLP)
      manufacturing process was developed to produce sufficient material for a phase
      I/II clinical trial. D2C7-IT was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter
      in Escherichia coli BLR (lambda DE3). D2C7-IT was produced by a 10-L batch
      fermentation process and was then purified from inclusion bodies using anion
      exchange, size exclusion, and an endotoxin removal process that achieved a yield 
      of over 300 mg of purified protein. The final vialed batch of D2C7-IT for
      clinical testing was at a concentration of 0.12 +/- 0.1 mg/mL, the pH was at 7.4 
      +/- 0.4, and endotoxin levels were below the detection limit of 10 EU/mL (1.26
      EU/mL). The stability of the vialed D2C7-IT has been monitored over a period of
      42 months through protein concentration, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
      gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing, size exclusion
      chromatography, cytotoxicity, sterility, and pH measurements. The vialed D2C7-IT 
      is currently being tested in a phase I/II clinical trial by intratumoral
      convection-enhanced delivery for 72 h in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      (NCT02303678, D2C7 for Adult Patients with Recurrent Malignant Glioma;
      clinicaltrials.gov ).

TI  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FEATURES OF INTRAVENTRICULAR EPENDYMOMAS IN Five CATS.
PG  - 326-333
LID - 10.1111/vru.12464 [doi]
AB  - Intraventricular ependymoma is a rare type of feline intracranial neoplasia and
      published information on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics is
      currently lacking. The purpose of this retrospective case series study was to
      describe the clinical and MRI characteristics of histopathologically confirmed
      intraventricular ependymomas in a group of cats. Five cats met inclusion
      criteria. In relation to normal gray matter, ependymomas appeared hyperintense on
      T2W, T2W-FLAIR, PD, and DW-EPI images; isointense on ADC images; and had subtle
      to strong contrast enhancement. Some variability was seen on T2*GRE and on T1W
      images with masses being isointense to hyperintense. Four ependymomas were small 
      and homogeneous, and one was centrally cavitated. All cats had obstructive
      hydrocephalus, transtentorial herniation, and foramen magnum herniation.
      Perilesional edema was identified in most cats but was questionable in one.
      Intraventricular ependymoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis for 
      cats with this combination of MRI signs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor
      in adults. Current standard of care involves maximal surgical resection combined 
      with adjuvant chemoradiation. Growing support exists for a role of immunotherapy 
      in treating these tumors with the goal of targeted cytotoxicity. Here we review
      data on the safety for current immunotherapies being tested in GBM. Areas
      covered: Safety data from published clinical trials, including ongoing clinical
      trials were reviewed. Immunotherapeutic classes currently under investigation in 
      GBM include various vaccination strategies, adoptive T cell immunotherapy, immune
      checkpoint blockade, monoclonal antibodies, and cytokine therapies. Trials
      include children, adolescents, and adults with either primary or recurrent GBM.
      Expert opinion: Based on the reviewed clinical trials, the current
      immunotherapies targeting GBM are safe and well-tolerated with minimal toxicities
      which should be noted. However, the gains in patient survival have been modest. A
      safe and well-tolerated combinatory immunotherapeutic approach may be essential
      for optimal efficacy towards GBM.

TI  - Antibody depletion strategy for the treatment of suspected antibody-mediated
      rejection in lung transplant recipients: Does it work?
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12886 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) after lung transplantation correlate
      with poor outcomes. The ideal treatment strategy for antibody-mediated rejection 
      AMR is not defined. Our institution implemented an aggressive multimodality
      protocol for the treatment of suspected AMR. METHODS: Lung transplant recipients 
      with suspected AMR were treated with a standardized protocol of plasma exchange, 
      steroids, bortezomib, rituximab, and intravenous immune globulin. Primary outcome
      was DSA clearance at 6 months in those alive. Secondary endpoints included
      preserved allograft function at 6 months, survival at 6 and 12 months and
      complications due to the protocol. RESULTS: Sixteen lung transplant recipients
      with documented DSA and allograft dysfunction were included in the analysis. Of
      the 16 patients, 11 survived to 6 months. Three of those 11 patients (27%)
      cleared all DSAs within 6 months of the protocol. Four of the 11 patients (36%)
      had preserved allograft function at 6 months. Overall 12-month patient survival
      was 56%. Complications included thrombocytopenia (50%) and abdominal pain or
      gastrointestinal discomfort (18.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This multimodality protocol
      resulted in clearance of DSAs and preserved lung function in a minority of lung
      transplant recipients with suspected AMR surviving to 6 months after therapy.
      There were significant side effects of the protocol.

TI  - Deubiquitinase USP13 maintains glioblastoma stem cells by antagonizing
      FBXL14-mediated Myc ubiquitination.
PG  - 245-267
LID - 10.1084/jem.20151673 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma is the most lethal brain tumor and harbors glioma stem cells (GSCs) 
      with potent tumorigenic capacity. The function of GSCs in tumor propagation is
      maintained by several core transcriptional regulators including c-Myc. c-Myc
      protein is tightly regulated by posttranslational modification. However, the
      posttranslational regulatory mechanisms for c-Myc in GSCs have not been defined. 
      In this study, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase USP13 stabilizes c-Myc by
      antagonizing FBXL14-mediated ubiquitination to maintain GSC self-renewal and
      tumorigenic potential. USP13 was preferentially expressed in GSCs, and its
      depletion potently inhibited GSC proliferation and tumor growth by promoting
      c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. In contrast, overexpression of the
      ubiquitin E3 ligase FBXL14 induced c-Myc degradation, promoted GSC
      differentiation, and inhibited tumor growth. Ectopic expression of the
      ubiquitin-insensitive mutant T58A-c-Myc rescued the effects caused by FBXL14
      overexpression or USP13 disruption. These data suggest that USP13 and FBXL14 play
      opposing roles in the regulation of GSCs through reversible ubiquitination of
      c-Myc.

TI  - Characterization of the blood brain barrier in pediatric central nervous system
      neoplasms.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The normal blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of tight junctions
      between endothelial cells and surrounding astrocyte foot processes. Breakdown of 
      the physiological astrocyte-endothelial cell relationship occurs in adult
      metastatic and primary brain tumors. However, the astrocyte-endothelial cell
      relationship has not been studied in pediatric tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Utilizing specimens from cases of pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 5), medulloblastoma 
      (n = 5), and low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (n = 1), immunofluorescence were
      performed using primary antibodies against CD31, glial fibrillary acidic protein 
      (GFAP), and aquaporin 4 (AQ4). Clinical, magnetic resonance imaging, operative,
      and histopathological findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Strongly-enhancing areas
      of medulloblastoma exhibited complete BBB breakdown with sparse GFAP and AQ4
      staining around CD31-positive vessels. Moderately enhancing regions of pilocytic 
      astrocytomas exhibited regions of intact BBB and vasculature surrounded by dense 
      GFAP staining but reduced and disorganized AQ4 staining, suggesting tumor cells
      could not fulfill physiological BBB support. Non-enhancing low-grade diffuse
      astrocytoma demonstrated intact BBB with intense peri-microvasculature GFAP and
      AQ4 staining. AQ4 stained so strongly that AQ4 visualization alone delineated
      CD31-positive vessels. CONCLUSION: Taken together, BBB breakdown in pediatric
      tumors corresponds to a loss of normal endothelial cell-astrocyte foot process
      relationships. Further development of pharmaceutical agents capitalizing on this 
      disrupted BBB is warranted in medulloblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. However,
      BBB integrity remains a challenge in treating low-grade diffuse astrocytoma
      before progression toward secondary glioblastoma.

TI  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: research and clinical updates.
PG  - 262-268
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains an important diagnosis to consider
      in hospitalized patients developing thrombocytopenia. HIT is an immune-mediated
      prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and
      heparin. Recent basic scientific studies have advanced our understanding of
      disease pathogenesis through studies of the PF4/heparin structure, immune
      mechanisms, and cellular basis of thrombosis. Clinical advances have also
      occurred in areas of HIT prevention, description of disease variants, and
      diagnostic strategies. Emerging anticoagulants with the potential to change HIT
      treatment are evolving, although with limited data. This review will provide a
      current perspective on HIT pathogenesis, disease features, diagnostic strategies,
      and role of emerging therapies for the management of HIT.

      Hydrocephalus Mimics with Parkinsonian Syndromes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with the classical idiopathic normal pressure
      hydrocephalus (iNPH) triad often show additional parkinsonian spectrum signs.
      Accurate differential diagnosis strongly influences the long-term outcome of
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to find 
      potential CSF microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for NPH mimics with parkinsonian
      syndromes that can reliably distinguish them from iNPH patients. METHODS: Two
      cohorts of 81 patients (cohort 1, n = 55; cohort 2, n = 26) with possible iNPH
      who were treated in two centers between January 2011 and May 2014 were studied.
      In both cohorts, CSF samples were obtained from patients clinically diagnosed
      with iNPH (n = 21 and n = 10, respectively), possible iNPH with parkinsonian
      spectrum (PS) (n = 18, n = 10, respectively), possible iNPH with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) (n = 16), and non-affected elderly individuals (NC) (n = 6). A
      three-step qRT-PCR analysis of the CSF samples was performed to detect miRNAs
      that were differentially expressed in the groups. RESULTS: The expression of
      hsa-miR-4274 in CSF was decreased in both cohorts of PS group patients (cohort 1:
      p < 0.0001, cohort 2: p < 0.0001), and was able to distinguish PS from iNPH with 
      high accuracy (area under the curve = 0.908). The CSF concentration of
      hsa-miR-4274 also correlated with the specific binding ratio of ioflupane (123I) 
      dopamine transporter scan (r = -0.494, p = 0.044). By contrast, the level of
      hsa-miR-4274 was significantly increased in the PS group after CSF diversion.
      CONCLUSION: Levels of CSF hsa-miR-4274 can differentiate PS from patients with
      iNPH, AD, and NC. This may be clinically useful for diagnostic purposes and
      predicting shunt treatment responses.

TI  - A Hyperpigmented Reticular Rash in a Patient on Peritoneal Dialysis.
PG  - 699-700
AB  - Chronically ill patients often develop uncommon exam findings. A 16-year-old
      female with end-stage renal disease secondary to immune complex-mediated
      glomerulonephritis on peritoneal dialysis (PD) developed a pruritic,
      hyperpigmented reticular rash on her abdomen, sparing the PD catheter insertion
      site. The rash appeared approximately 6 weeks after initiating PD. She used a
      heating pad nightly during PD for dialysis drain pain. Testing for systemic and
      autoimmune disease was negative. She was referred to dermatology, where the
      diagnosis of erythema ab igne (EAI), a well-described but less well-known
      hyperpigmented reticular cutaneous eruption caused by chronic exposure to low
      levels of infrared heat, was confirmed. The eruption is typically painless but is
      often pruritic. Common sources of heat include fires, stoves, portable heaters,
      heating pads, and laptop computers. The association between EAI and PD is
      unknown. Our patient discontinued the heating pad and her rash resolved.

TI  - Septooptic Dysplasia with an Associated Arachnoid Cyst.
PG  - 5493769
AB  - A 4-week-old male infant presented with hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and
      hyperbilirubinemia. His medical history was remarkable for hydrocephalus
      secondary to an arachnoid cyst, intermittent hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and poor 
      feeding requiring nasogastric tube for nutrition. Physical exam revealed
      retrognathia, mild hypotonia, micropenis, and clinodactyly. Ophthalmologic exam
      demonstrated bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH). Laboratory data confirmed
      inadequate cortisol and growth hormone response to hypoglycemia, a low thyroxine 
      level, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
      confirmed the known history of arachnoid cyst with hydrocephalus but also
      revealed anterior pituitary hypoplasia, absence of the posterior pituitary bright
      spot, a thin pituitary stalk, and bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia. A diagnosis
      of septooptic dysplasia (SOD) was made. Hormone replacement with hydrocortisone
      and levothyroxine was started with improvement in the infant's glycemic control, 
      thermoregulation, feeding, and cholestasis. This case reinforces the importance
      of careful physical examination and laboratory review in a patient with known
      history of arachnoid cyst which has been previously described as an associated
      feature of optic nerve hypoplasia and hypopituitarism.

AB  - The breadth of tumors that can arise in the supratentorial brain in children is
      extensive. With the exception of those that result in seizures and the highly
      malignant histologies, supratentorial tumors may come to medical attention later 
      compared with infratentorial tumors, as they are less commonly associated with
      ventricular obstruction. This article presents an overview of the neuroimaging
      characteristics of these entities, with particular attention to relevant features
      that may aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis, including correlation with 
      demographics and clinical presentation.

TI  - Plasma microRNAs are associated with acute exacerbation in idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis.
PG  - 135
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) has high
      short-term mortality with unknown causes. To predict this malignant condition in 
      clinics is challenging. In this study, we aim to demonstrate whether there are
      miRNAs that differ between AE-IPF and stable IPF, which may be served as reliable
      biomarker for AE-IPF prediction. METHODS: Human fibrotic-associated miRNAs arrays
      were designed to detect miRNAs expression in plasma of 3 AE-IPF patients, 3
      Stable-IPF (S-IPF) patients and 3 normal controls (NC). Differentially expressed 
      miRNAs between AE-IPF and S-IPF patients were selected for further analyses. The 
      validation studies were carried out in plasma of 12 AE-IPF patients, 45 S-IPF
      patients and 51 healthy control subjects. Signaling pathways and cellular
      processes interacted with validated miRNAs were predicted by DIANA-miRPath.
      RESULTS: According to the array analysis, 6 miRNAs showed differentiated
      expression between AE-IPF and S-IPF patients (P < 0.05). In the validation
      studies, let-7d-5p was decreased in S-IPF and further decreased in AE-IPF, when
      compared to NC (0.0003 +/- 0.0002 vs 0.003 +/- 0.002, P < 0.01 and 0.0007 +/-
      0.0005 vs 0.003 +/- 0.002, P < 0.01). While miR-25-3p was obviously decreased in 
      S-IPF (0.0002 +/- 0.0001 vs 0.0003 +/- 0.0003, P < 0.01) but significantly
      increased in AE-IP (0.0023 +/- 0.002 vs 0.0003 +/- 0.0003, P < 0.01). In
      receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the areas under the curve 
      (AUCs) of miR-25-3p and let-7d-5p were 0.83 and 0.75, respectively. The
      sensitivity at fixed specificity of 90% was improved from 50% to 66.7% when the
      two miRNAs were combined. The functional prediction of miRNAs suggested that the 
      loss of anti-fibrotic capacity and the gain of uncontrolled cell growth may be
      required in AE-IPF pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, miR-25-3p and
      let-7d-5p in plasma were differentially expressed between AE-IPF and S-IPF. A
      combination of these two miRNAs may be a potential biomarker for AE-IPF from IPF.

TI  - Polyphosphate/platelet factor 4 complexes can mediate heparin-independent
      platelet activation in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 62-74
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016000877 [doi]
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a thrombotic disorder initiated by
      antibodies to complexes between platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The risk of 
      recurrent thromboembolism persists after heparin is cleared and platelet
      activation leading to release of PF4 has dissipated. We asked whether antigenic
      complexes between polyphosphates and PF4 released from activated platelets might 
      intensify or sustain the prothrombotic phenotype of HIT. PF4 forms stable,
      ultralarge complexes with polyphosphates of various sizes, including those
      released from platelets, which are recognized by the HIT-like monoclonal KKO, an 
      immunoglobulin G2bkappa monoclonal heparin/PF4 binding antibody, and by human HIT
      antibodies. KKO helps to protect PF4/polyphosphate complexes from degradation by 
      phosphatases. Complement is activated when HIT antibodies bind to
      PF4/polyphosphate complexes and PF4 reverses the inhibition of complement by
      polyphosphates. Polyphosphates and PF4 are stored primarily in separate granules 
      in resting platelets, but they colocalize when the cells are activated. Platelets
      activated by subaggregating doses of thrombin receptor activating peptide release
      polyphosphates and PF4, which form antigenic complexes that allow KKO to further 
      activate platelets in the absence of heparin and exogenous PF4. These studies
      suggest that thrombin- or immune complex-mediated release of endogenous antigenic

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further evaluate if a delay in the start of radiation therapy (RT) 
      affects patient outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May
      1999 to May 2010, a total of 161 patients underwent surgery followed by RT for
      GBM. We assessed overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS),
      stratified by extent of surgical resection. Included in the analysis were genomic
      predictors of progression. RESULTS: Median time from surgery to start of RT was
      20days for biopsy alone, 28days for subtotal resection (STR) and 28days for gross
      total resection (GTR). For all patients, a delay >28days did not result in a
      difference in PFS when compared to no delay (6.7 vs. 6.9 months, p=0.07). PFS was
      improved in biopsy or STR patients with a >28day delay to start of RT (4.2 vs.
      6.7 months, p=0.006). OS was also improved in patients receiving biopsy or STR
      with a >28day delay to start of RT (12.3 vs. 7.8 months, p=0.005). Multivariable 
      analysis (MVA) demonstrated an improvement in OS and PFS with time to RT >28days 
      for biopsy or STR patients (HR 0.52 p=0.008 and HR 0.48 p=0.02, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: In this retrospective review of GBM patients treated at a single
      institution, OS and PFS were not different between time to RT >28days compared to
      <28 days. There was a modest improvement in both PFS and OS in patients who
      received biopsy or STR with time to RT >28 days.

TI  - Loss of epithelial Gq and G11 signaling inhibits TGFbeta production but promotes 
      IL-33-mediated macrophage polarization and emphysema.
PG  - ra104
AB  - Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling links
      hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors with four G protein signaling pathways.
      Two of these, one mediated by Gq and G11 (Gq/11) and the other by G12 and G13
      (G12/13), are implicated in the force-dependent activation of transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGFbeta) in lung epithelial cells. Reduced TGFbeta activation in
      alveolar cells leads to emphysema, whereas enhanced TGFbeta activation promotes
      acute lung injury and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, precise control
      of alveolar TGFbeta activation is essential for alveolar homeostasis. We
      investigated the involvement of the Gq/11 and G12/13 pathways in epithelial cells
      in generating active TGFbeta and regulating alveolar inflammation. Mice deficient
      in both Galphaq and Galpha11 developed inflammation that was primarily caused by 
      alternatively activated (M2-polarized) macrophages, enhanced matrix
      metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) production, and age-related alveolar airspace
      enlargement consistent with emphysema. Mice with impaired Gq/11 signaling had
      reduced stretch-mediated generation of TGFbeta by epithelial cells and enhanced
      macrophage MMP12 synthesis but were protected from the effects of
      ventilator-induced lung injury. Furthermore, synthesis of the cytokine
      interleukin-33 (IL-33) was increased in these alveolar epithelial cells,
      resulting in the M2-type polarization of alveolar macrophages independently of
      the effect on TGFbeta. Our results suggest that alveolar Gq/11 signaling
      maintains alveolar homeostasis and likely independently increases TGFbeta
      activation in response to the mechanical stress of the epithelium and decreases
      epithelial IL-33 synthesis. Together, these findings suggest that disruption of
      Gq/11 signaling promotes inflammatory emphysema but protects against mechanically
      induced lung injury.

TI  - Microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannomas: complication avoidance.
PG  - 367-375
AB  - Vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery requires appropriate patient selection,
      meticulous microsurgical technique and optimal post-operative care. Focused
      radiation is an effective alternative for the treatment of smaller VSs. For VS
      surgery to remain a reasonable option, surgery must be performed with a limited
      number of complications. Complication rates for VS surgery have increased over
      the last decade. This is likely due to (1) decreased surgical volume and as a
      result decreased microsurgical experience, (2) larger tumors undergoing surgery
      while smaller tumors are reserved for radiation, and (3) surgery for previously
      radiated tumors resulting in more difficult anatomic dissection. Appropriate
      management of complications is paramount. Herein, we discuss complications
      related to VS microsurgery and methods of avoidance. Specifically, we discuss the
      most frequently encountered complications, intraoperative monitoring and finally,
      methods of addressing these complications. With meticulous microsurgical
      technique, careful intraoperative monitoring and vigilant perioperative care one 
      will ensure optimal patient outcomes.

TI  - Immune pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 792-798
AB  - The immune response to heparin is one of the most common drug-induced allergies, 
      and yet, atypical for a drug hypersensitivity reaction. Whereas most drug-induced
      allergies are rare, idiosyncratic and life-long, the allergic response to heparin
      is common, predictable in certain clinical settings and transient. Advances in
      the last decade with regards to structural characterisation of the PF4/heparin
      antigenic complex, contributions of innate immunity and development of animal
      models have provided insights into the distinctive features of the HIT immune
      response. Recent descriptions of the crystal structure of the PF4/heparin
      complex, alongside other biophysical studies, have clarified the structural
      requirements for immunogenicity and heparin-dependency of antibody formation.
      Studies of interactions of PF4 with bacterial cell walls as well as epidemiologic
      associations of anti-PF4/heparin antibody formation and infection suggest a role 
      for immune priming and explain the rapid evolution of an isotype-switched immune 
      response in sensitised patients. Murine models have greatly facilitated
      investigations of cellular basis of the HIT response and identified a major role 
      for T-cells and marginal zone B-cells, but key findings have yet to be validated 
      in human disease. This chapter will summarise recent investigations of the HIT
      immune response in the context of major pathways of immune activation and
      identify areas of uncertainty.

TI  - MERTK Inhibition Induces Polyploidy and Promotes Cell Death and Cellular
      Senescence in Glioblastoma Multiforme.
PG  - e0165107
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) is expressed in a variety of
      malignancies, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our previous work
      demonstrated that inhibition of MERTK using RNA interference induced cell death
      and chemosensitivity in GBM cells, implicating MERTK as a potential therapeutic
      target. Here we investigate whether a novel MERTK-selective small molecule
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, UNC2025, has similar anti-tumor effects in GBM cell
      lines. METHODS: Correlations between expression of GAS6, a MERTK ligand, and
      prognosis were determined using data from the TCGA database. GBM cell lines
      (A172, SF188, U251) were treated in vitro with increasing doses of UNC2025
      (50-400nM). Cell count and viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion.
      Cell cycle profiles and induction of apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometric
      analysis after BrdU or Po-Pro-1/propidium iodide staining, respectively.
      Polyploidy was detected by propidium iodide staining and metaphase spread.
      Cellular senescence was determined by beta-galactosidase staining and
      senescence-associated secretory cytokine analysis. RESULTS: Decreased overall
      survival significantly correlated with high levels of GAS6 expression in GBM,
      highlighting the importance of TAM kinase signaling in GBM tumorigenesis and/or
      therapy resistance and providing strong rationale for targeting these pathways in
      the clinic. All three GBM cell lines exhibited dose dependent reductions in cell 
      number and colony formation (>90% at 200nM) after treatment with UNC2025. Cell
      cycle analysis demonstrated accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase and
      development of polyploidy. After extended exposure, 60-80% of cells underwent
      apoptosis. The majority of surviving cells (65-95%) were senescent and did not
      recover after drug removal. Thus, UNC2025 mediates anti-tumor activity in GBM by 
      multiple mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings described here provide further
      evidence of oncogenic roles for MERTK in GBM, demonstrate the importance of
      kinase activity for MERTK tumorigenicity and validate UNC2025, a novel MERTK
      inhibitor, as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of GBM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), the coexistence
      of noncardiac congenital anatomic abnormalities (NC), genetic abnormalities (GA),
      and syndromes (S) may influence therapeutic strategies and outcomes. The
      appreciated prevalence of these abnormalities has risen because increased
      screening and improved diagnostic precision enable identification of these
      comorbidities in a larger fraction of neonates with CHD. We examined the
      contemporary prevalence and distribution of NC/GA/S across diagnostic groups
      among neonates undergoing cardiac operations using a large nationally
      representative clinical registry. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons
      Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) was queried to identify neonates
      (</=30 days) who underwent index cardiac operations from 2010 to 2013. The
      fundamental cardiac diagnosis was used to identify 10 diagnostic groups. The
      prevalence of NC/GA/S was reported across each group. RESULTS: The cohort
      included 15,376 index neonatal operations from 112 centers. Overall, 18.8% (2,894
      of 15,376) of operations were performed in neonates with NC/GA/S. Patients with
      atrioventricular septal defect (212 of 357 [59.4%]), interrupted aortic arch (248
      of 567 [43.7%]), truncus arteriosus (204 of 554 [36.8%]), and tetralogy of Fallot
      (417 of 1,383 [30.2%]) had the highest prevalence of NC/GA/S abnormalities,
      whereas those with transposition of the great arteries (111 of 2,778 [4.0%]) had 
      the lowest prevalence. The most commonly identified NC/GA/S included heterotaxy
      (597 of 15,376 [3.9%]), DiGeorge syndrome or 22q11 deletion (550 of 15,376
      [3.6%]), Down syndrome or trisomy 21 (318 of 15, 376 [2.1%]), intestinal
      malrotation (220 of 15,376 [1.4%]), and Turner syndrome or 45XO (189 of 15,376
      [1.2%]). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NC/GA/S varies widely across CHD
      diagnostic groups. This information may be useful for patient counseling,
      recommendations for screening for anomalies and genetic disorders, and
      perioperative management.

PG  - 1695-1696
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.6362 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Mucolipidosis II (Inclusion cell or I-cell disease) is an autosomal
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder clinically comparable to the
      mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), characterized by progressive respiratory and
      neurologic deterioration. Sleep problems, especially obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) and disrupted sleep architecture, are observed in other lysosomal storage
      diseases but have not been described in mucolipidosis II. We report the
      progression of polysomnographic abnormalities in a child with mucolipidosis II,
      demonstrated by worsening sleep-related hypoventilation, OSA, and sleep state
      fragmentation despite advancing PAP therapy. Background slowing and reduction in 
      spindle activity on limited EEG may reflect progressive CNS disease affecting
      thalamic neurons.

TI  - Frontal Hypoactivation During a Working Memory Task in Children With 22q11
      Deletion Syndrome.
PG  - 94-99

AB  - Impairments in executive function, such as working memory, are almost universal
      in children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Delineating the neural
      underpinnings of these functions would enhance understanding of these
      impairments. In this study, children and adolescents with 22q11 deletion syndrome
      were compared with healthy control participants in a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) study of working memory. When the 2-back condition was
      contrasted with the 1-back and 0-back conditions, the participants with 22q11
      deletion syndrome showed lower activation in several brain areas involved in
      working memory-notably dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and
      precuneus. This hypoactivation may be due to reduced gray matter volumes or white
      matter connectivity in the frontal and parietal regions, differences that have
      previously been documented in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome.
      Understanding differences in brain function will provide a foundation for future 
      interventions to address the wide range of neurodevelopmental deficits observed
      in 22q11 deletion syndrome.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of 176 patients with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome treated with

AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIGM) is a primary immunodeficiency
      with high morbidity and mortality compared with those seen in healthy subjects.
      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been considered a curative therapy, 
      but the procedure has inherent complications and might not be available for all
      patients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to collect data on the clinical presentation,
      treatment, and follow-up of a large sample of patients with XHIGM to (1) compare 
      long-term overall survival and general well-being of patients treated with or
      without HCT along with clinical factors associated with mortality and (2)
      summarize clinical practice and risk factors in the subgroup of patients treated 
      with HCT. METHODS: Physicians caring for patients with primary immunodeficiency
      diseases were identified through the Jeffrey Modell Foundation, United States
      Immunodeficiency Network, Latin American Society for Immunodeficiency, and
      Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium. Data were collected with a
      Research Electronic Data Capture Web application. Survival from time of diagnosis
      or transplantation was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method compared with
      log-rank tests and modeled by using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS:
      Twenty-eight clinical sites provided data on 189 patients given a diagnosis of
      XHIGM between 1964 and 2013; 176 had valid follow-up and vital status
      information. Sixty-seven (38%) patients received HCT. The average follow-up time 
      was 8.5 +/- 7.2 years (range, 0.1-36.2 years). No difference in overall survival 
      was observed between patients treated with or without HCT (P = .671). However,
      risk associated with HCT decreased for diagnosis years 1987-1995; the hazard
      ratio was significantly less than 1 for diagnosis years 1995-1999. Liver disease 
      was a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95%
      confidence limits, 2.2-10.8; P < .001). Among survivors, those treated with HCT
      had higher median Karnofsky/Lansky scores than those treated without HCT (P <
      .001). Among patients receiving HCT, 27 (40%) had graft-versus-host disease, and 
      most deaths occurred within 1 year of transplantation. CONCLUSION: No difference 
      in survival was observed between patients treated with or without HCT across all 
      diagnosis years (1964-2013). However, survivors treated with HCT experienced
      somewhat greater well-being, and hazards associated with HCT decreased, reaching 
      levels of significantly less risk in the late 1990s. Among patients treated with 
      HCT, treatment at an early age is associated with improved survival. Optimism
      remains guarded as additional evidence accumulates.

AB  - Ideal hypoparathyroidism animal models are a prerequisite to developing new
      treatment modalities for this disorder. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the feasibility of a model whereby rats were parathyroidectomized (PTX) using a
      fluorescent-identification method and the ideal calcium content of the diet was
      determined. Thirty male rats were divided into surgical sham (SHAM, n = 5) and
      PTX plus 0, 0.5, and 2% calcium diet groups (PTX-FC (n = 5), PTX-NC (n = 10), and
      PTX-HC (n = 10), respectively). Serum parathyroid hormone levels decreased to
      non-detectable levels in all PTX groups. All animals in the PTX-FC group died
      within 4 days after the operation. All animals survived when supplied calcium in 
      the diet. However, serum calcium levels were higher in the PTX-HC than the SHAM
      group. The PTX-NC group demonstrated the most representative modeling of primary 
      hypothyroidism. Serum calcium levels decreased and phosphorus levels increased,
      and bone volume was increased. All animals survived without further treatment and
      did not show nephrotoxicity including calcium deposits. These findings
      demonstrate that PTX animal models produced by using the
      fluorescent-identification method, and fed a 0.5% calcium diet, are appropriate
      for hypoparathyroidism treatment studies.

AB  - Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), severe nausea/vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), can cause
      poor maternal/fetal outcomes. Genetic predisposition suggests the genetic
      component is essential in discovering an etiology. We performed whole-exome
      sequencing of 5 families followed by analysis of variants in 584 cases/431
      controls. Variants in RYR2 segregated with disease in 2 families. The novel
      variant L3277R was not found in any case/control. The rare variant, G1886S was
      more common in cases (p = 0.046) and extreme cases (p = 0.023). Replication of
      G1886S using Norwegian/Australian data was supportive. Common variants rs790899
      and rs1891246 were significantly associated with HG and weight loss. Copy-number 
      analysis revealed a deletion in a patient. RYR2 encodes an intracellular calcium 
      release channel involved in vomiting, cyclic-vomiting syndrome, and is a thyroid 
      hormone target gene. Additionally, RYR2 is a downstream drug target of Inderal,
      used to treat HG and CVS. Thus, herein we provide genetic evidence for a pathway 
      and therapy for HG.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous epidemiologic studies attempting to demonstrate
      the risk of kidney diseases among patients with celiac disease (CD) have yielded 
      inconsistent results. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize
      all available evidence. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE 
      and EMBASE from inception to May 2016. Studies that provided relative risks, odd 
      ratios, or hazard ratios examining the risk of kidney diseases among patients
      with CD versus individuals without CD were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 
      95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic
      inverse variance method. RESULTS: Eight studies met our eligibility criteria and 
      were included in our analysis. A pooled RR of overall kidney diseases in patients
      with CD was 2.01 (95% CI, 1.44-2.81, I(2)=76%). The pooled RR of end-stage renal 
      disease in patients with CD was 2.57 (95% CI, 2.03-3.24). Subgroup analyses
      showed that significant risks were increased for diabetic nephropathy (pooled RR 
      of 1.49, 95% CI, 1.09-2.02) and IgA nephropathy (pooled RR of 2.62, 95% CI,
      1.27-5.42) in patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a
      significantly increased risk of kidney diseases among patients with CD. These
      findings may influence clinical management and primary prevention of kidney
      diseases in patients with CD.

TI  - Burden of disease in adult patients with hypophosphatasia: Results from two
      patient-reported surveys.

LID - S0026-0495(16)30070-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare metabolic bone disease caused by
      loss-of-function mutation(s) in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline (TNSALP)
      phosphatase gene, which manifests as rickets and/or osteomalacia with systemic
      complications and affects patients of all ages. The burden of disease is poorly
      characterized in adult patients. AIMS: We assessed patient-reported burden of
      disease using two surveys reasonably specific for HPP symptomatology, the
      Hypophosphatasia Impact Patient Survey (HIPS) and the Hypophosphatasia Outcomes
      Study Telephone interview (HOST). METHODS: Patients with HPP were invited to
      participate via patient advocacy groups or their medical provider. Survey
      questions captured demography, HPP-related medical history, mobility, and
      health-related quality of life (using Short Form 12 [version 2] Health Survey
      [SF-12v2]) via internet report (HIPS) or telephone interview (HOST). RESULTS: One
      hundred twenty-five adults responded (mean [standard deviation, SD] age: 45
      [14.3] years). Eighty-four patients (67%) reported pediatric-onset of their
      symptoms. Common clinical features in the study population included pain (95% of 
      patients), fractures (86% of patients) muscle weakness (62%) and unusual gait
      (52%). Use of assistive devices for mobility (60%) was also prevalent. Twenty-six
      percent of patients reported more than 10 fractures. Seventy-four percent of
      patients had undergone orthopedic/dental surgical procedures. The health profile 
      of patients responding on the SF-12 showed a broad and substantial impact of HPP 
      on health-related quality of life, with domains related to physical ability
      showing the greatest decrement compared to normative data. CONCLUSIONS: In
      aggregate, these data indicate that HPP can confer a high burden of illness in
      adulthood.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Patients with Heterozygous Familial
      Hypercholesterolemia and LDL-C of 160 mg/dl or Higher.
PG  - 473-483
AB  - PURPOSE: Even with statins and other lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), many patients 
      with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) continue to have elevated 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. ODYSSEY HIGH FH (NCT01617655)
      assessed the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody, versus placebo in patients with heFH
      and LDL-C >/= 160 mg/dl despite maximally tolerated statin +/- other LLT.
      METHODS: Patients were randomized to subcutaneous alirocumab 150 mg or placebo
      every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 78 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change in
      LDL-C from baseline to week 24. RESULTS: Mean baseline LDL-C levels were 196.3
      mg/dl in the alirocumab (n = 71) and 201.0 mg/dl in the placebo groups (n = 35). 
      Significant mean (standard error [SE]) reductions in LDL-C from baseline to week 
      24 were observed with alirocumab (-45.7 [3.5] %) versus placebo (-6.6 [4.9] %), a
      difference of -39.1 (6.0) % (P < 0.0001). Absolute mean (SE) LDL-C levels were
      reduced from baseline by 90.8 (6.7) mg/dl with alirocumab at week 24, with
      reductions maintained to week 78. Treatment-emergent adverse events were
      generally comparable between groups. Injection-site reactions were more frequent 
      in the alirocumab group (8.3 %) versus placebo (5.7 %); most were mild in
      severity and did not result in study medication discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with heFH and very high LDL-C baseline levels despite maximally
      tolerated statin +/- other LLT, alirocumab 150 mg Q2W demonstrated significant
      reductions in LDL-C levels with 41 % of patients achieving predefined LDL-C
      goals. Alirocumab was generally well tolerated.

AB  - Malignant transformation of intracranial neurenteric cysts (NCs) has been
      reported in only 7 cases, but the molecular characteristics leading to malignant 
      transformation remain unclear. A 61-year-old woman presented with headache and
      dizziness. Imaging revealed a 10-cm, extra-axial cystic mass in both middle
      fossae. A partial resection was performed, and the residual mass size gradually
      decreased. She had repeated ventriculoperitoneal shunts to relieve symptoms of
      hydrocephalus. Eight years later, follow-up images revealed marked enlargement of
      the mass and a newly developed lesion. After a second partial resection, a
      mucinous adenocarcinoma infiltrating the brain was identified. Transitions from
      benign-looking cuboidal cells to dysplastic cells were observed. A KRAS mutation,
      which might be associated with malignant NC transformation and was not present in
      the initial specimen, was identified in the adenocarcinoma. In conclusion,
      KRAS-mutant mucinous adenocarcinoma may arise in a longstanding residual NC after
      partial resection.

      Studies of [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The hypoxia PET tracer,
      1-[18F]fluoro-3-(2-nitro-1Himidazol- 1-yl)-propan-2-ol ([18F]FMISO) is the first 
      radiotracer developed for hypoxia PET imaging and has shown promising for cancer 
      diagnosis and prognosis. However, access to [18F]FMISO radiotracer is limited due
      to the needed cyclotron and radiochemistry expertise. The study aimed to develop 
      the automated production method on the [18F]FMISO radiotracer with the novel
      fully automated platform of the BG75 system and validate its usage on animal
      tumor models. METHOD: [18F]FMISO was produced with the dose synthesis cartridge
      automatically on the BG75 system. Validation of [18F]FMISO hypoxia imaging
      functionality was conducted on two tumor mouse models (FaDu/U87 tumor). The
      distribution of [18F]FMISO within tumor was further validated by the standard
      hypoxia marker EF5. RESULTS: The average radiochemical purity was (99+/-1) % and 
      the average pH was 5.5+/-0.2 with other quality attributes passing standard
      criteria (n=12). Overall biodistribution for [18F]FMISO in both tumor models was 
      consistent with reported studies where bladder and large intestines presented
      highest activity at 90 min post injection. High spatial correlation was found
      between [18F]FMISO autoradiography and EF5 hypoxia staining, indicating high
      hypoxia specificity of [18MF]FMISO. CONCLUSION: This study shows that qualified
      [18F]FMISO can be efficiently produced on the BG75 system in an automated
      "dose-on-demand" mode using single dose disposable cards. The possibilities of
      having a low-cost, automated system manufacturing ([18F]Fluoride production +
      synthesis + QC) different radiotracers will greatly enhance the potential for PET
      technology to reach new geographical areas and underserved patient populations.

AB  - Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a recessive genetically heterogeneous
      disorder of motile cilia with chronic otosinopulmonary disease and organ
      laterality defects in approximately 50% of cases. The prevalence of PCD is
      difficult to determine. Recent diagnostic advances through measurement of nasal
      nitric oxide and genetic testing has allowed rigorous diagnoses and determination
      of a robust clinical phenotype, which includes neonatal respiratory distress,
      daily nasal congestion, and wet cough starting early in life, along with organ
      laterality defects. There is early onset of lung disease in PCD with abnormal
      airflow mechanics and radiographic abnormalities detected in infancy and early
      childhood.

TI  - Advances and challenges: dendritic cell vaccination strategies for glioblastoma.
PG  - 27-36
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and
      prognosis remains poor with a median survival of approximately 15-17 months. This
      review provides an overview of recent advances in the field of glioblastoma
      immunotherapy. Areas covered: Recent advances in dendritic cell vaccination
      immunotherapy are showing encouraging results in clinical trials and promise to
      extend patient survival. In this report we discuss current scientific knowledge
      regarding dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, including approaches to differentiating, 
      priming, and injecting dendritic cells to achieve maximal anti-tumor efficacy in 
      glioblastoma. These findings are compared to recently completed and currently
      ongoing glioblastoma clinical trials. Novel methods such as 'fastDCs' and
      vaccines targeting DCs in-vivo may offer more effective treatment when compared
      to traditional DC vaccines and have already entered the clinic. Expert
      commentary: Finally, we discuss the challenges of T-cell dysfunctions caused by
      glioblastoma immunosuppression and how they affect dendritic cell vaccinations
      approaches.

TI  - Nitidine chloride inhibits the malignant behavior of human glioblastoma cells by 
      targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
PG  - 2160-8
LID - 10.3892/or.2016.4998 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that nitidine chloride (NC), a natural bioactive
      alkaloid, displays potent antitumor activity in various types of cancer. In the
      present study, NC was examined for efficacy in the treatment of human
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as well as the molecular basis for its more general
      inhibitory effects in cancer. U251 and U87 GBM cell lines were exposed to three
      concentrations of NC (5, 25 and 50 microM) in vitro, and tumor cell growth was
      assessed on the basis of proliferation, migration and energy metabolism.
      Decreases in viability and proliferation reached ~50% for both cell lines with 50
      microM NC at 24 h as assessed by cell viability Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and
      EdU assays. In wound closure and Transwell assays, migration and invasion were
      inhibited at 50 microM after 24 h (~20 and 80%, respectively; P<0.05). ATP and
      L-lactate levels were also decreased after treatment with NC (50 microM, 24 h;
      P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Finally, in western blot analysis,
      phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was suppressed by NC, but partially restored when
      cells were treated simultaneously with a novel Akt activator, SC79. Partial
      restoration was also observed in viability/proliferation (U251 and U87, ~15 vs.
      40%; NC vs. NC + SC79; P<0.05) and invasion (U251 and U87, ~30 vs. 60%; NC vs. NC
      + SC79; P<0.05). Our results demonstrated that NC inhibits development of GBM by 
      targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and provides a potential
      therapeutic agent for the treatment of GBM.

TI  - Amplification of TGFbeta Induced ITGB6 Gene Transcription May Promote Pulmonary
      Fibrosis.
PG  - e0158047
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158047 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, progressive disease with
      poor survival rates and limited treatment options. Upregulation of alphavbeta6
      integrins within the alveolar epithelial cells is a characteristic feature of IPF
      and correlates with poor patient survival. The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFbeta1 can
      upregulate alphavbeta6 integrin expression but the molecular mechanisms driving
      this effect have not previously been elucidated. We confirm that stimulation with
      exogenous TGFbeta1 increases expression of the integrin beta6 subunit gene
      (ITGB6) and alphavbeta6 integrin cell surface expression in a time- and
      concentration-dependent manner. TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via
      transcriptional activation of the ITGB6 gene, but does not result from effects on
      ITGB6 mRNA stability. Basal expression of ITGB6 in, and alphavbeta6 integrins on,
      lung epithelial cells occurs via homeostatic alphavbeta6-mediated TGFbeta1
      activation in the absence of exogenous stimulation, and can be amplified by
      TGFbeta1 activation. Fundamentally, we show for the first time that
      TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via canonical Smad signalling since
      dominant negative constructs directed against Smad3 and 4 inhibit ITGB6
      transcriptional activity. Furthermore, disruption of a Smad binding site at -798 
      in the ITGB6 promoter abolishes TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 transcriptional activity. 
      Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that TGFbeta1 stimulation of
      lung epithelial cells results in direct binding of Smad3, and Smad4, to the ITGB6
      gene promoter within this region. Finally, using an adenoviral TGFbeta1
      over-expression model of pulmonary fibrosis we demonstrate that Smad3 is crucial 
      for TGFbeta1-induced alphavbeta6 integrin expression within the alveolar
      epithelium in vivo. Together, these data confirm that a homeostatic, autocrine
      loop of alphavbeta6 integrin activated TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 gene expression
      regulates epithelial basal alphavbeta6 integrin expression, and demonstrates that
      this occurs via Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation at a single Smad
      binding site in the promoter of the beta6 subunit gene. Active TGFbeta1 amplifies
      this pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which may promote fibrosis.

AB  - We sought to assess whether laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) is associated
      with decreased rates of disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF).The study was a retrospective single-centre study of IPF patients 
      with worsening symptoms and pulmonary function despite antacid treatment for
      abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux. The period of exposure to LARS was
      September 1998 to December 2012. The primary end-point was a longitudinal change 
      in forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted in the pre- versus post-surgery
      periods.27 patients with progressive IPF underwent LARS. At time of surgery, the 
      mean age was 65 years and mean FVC was 71.7% pred. Using a regression model, the 
      estimated benefit of surgery in FVC % pred over 1 year was 5.7% (95% CI
      -0.9-12.2%, p=0.088) with estimated benefit in FVC of 0.22 L (95% CI -0.06-0.49
      L, p=0.12). Mean DeMeester scores decreased from 42 to 4 (p<0.01). There were no 
      deaths in the 90 days following surgery and 81.5% of participants were alive 2
      years after surgery.Patients with IPF tolerated the LARS well. There were no
      statistically significant differences in rates of FVC decline pre- and post-LARS 
      over 1 year; a possible trend toward stabilisation in observed FVC warrants
      prospective studies. The ongoing prospective randomised controlled trial will
      hopefully provide further insights regarding the safety and potential efficacy of
      LARS in IPF.

TI  - Canine Butterfly Glioblastomas: A Neuroradiological Review.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2016.00040 [doi]
AB  - In humans, high-grade gliomas may infiltrate across the corpus callosum resulting
      in bihemispheric lesions that may have symmetrical, winged-like appearances. This
      particular tumor manifestation has been coined a "butterfly" glioma (BG). While
      canine and human gliomas share many neuroradiological and pathological features, 
      the BG morphology has not been previously reported in dogs. Here, we describe the
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of BG in three dogs and review
      the potential differential diagnoses based on neuroimaging findings. All dogs
      presented for generalized seizures and interictal neurological deficits referable
      to multifocal or diffuse forebrain disease. MRI examinations revealed
      asymmetrical (2/3) or symmetrical (1/3), bihemispheric intra-axial mass lesions
      that predominantly affected the frontoparietal lobes that were associated with
      extensive perilesional edema, and involvement of the corpus callosum. The masses 
      displayed heterogeneous T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal
      intensities, variable contrast enhancement (2/3), and mass effect. All tumors
      demonstrated classical histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM), including glial cell pseudopalisading, serpentine necrosis, microvascular 
      proliferation as well as invasion of the corpus callosum by neoplastic
      astrocytes. Although rare, GBM should be considered a differential diagnosis in
      dogs with an MRI evidence of asymmetric or symmetric bilateral, intra-axial
      cerebral mass lesions with signal characteristics compatible with glioma.

AB  - Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) with gelastic epilepsy is a well-recognized
      drug-resistant epilepsy syndrome of early life.(1) Surgical resection allows
      limited access to the small deep-seated lesions that cause the disease. Here, we 
      report the results of a search for somatic mutations in paired hamartoma- and
      leukocyte-derived DNA samples from 38 individuals which we conducted by using
      whole-exome sequencing (WES), chromosomal microarray (CMA), and targeted
      resequencing (TRS) of candidate genes. Somatic mutations were identified in genes
      involving regulation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway in 14/38 individuals
      (37%). Three individuals had somatic mutations in PRKACA, which encodes a
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase that acts as a repressor protein in the Shh
      pathway, and four subjects had somatic mutations in GLI3, an Shh pathway gene
      associated with HH. In seven other individuals, we identified two recurrent and
      three single brain-tissue-specific, large copy-number or loss-of-heterozygosity
      (LOH) variants involving multiple Shh genes, as well as other genes without an
      obvious biological link to the Shh pathway. The Shh pathway genes in these large 
      somatic lesions include the ligand itself (SHH and IHH), the receptor SMO, and
      several other Shh downstream pathway members, including CREBBP and GLI2. Taken
      together, our data implicate perturbation of the Shh pathway in at least 37% of
      individuals with the HH epilepsy syndrome, consistent with the concept of a
      developmental pathway brain disease.

      relatively rare due to their detection in utero and repair of the spinal
      malformation. Regardless of the type of brain anomaly, the most common clinical
      symptoms are mental retardation, hydrocephalus, and seizure; the latter two may
      need to be surgically and medically addressed. The most commonly found spinal
      congenital anomalies include the filum terminale lipoma which is generally
      asymptomatic and incidental and the caudal regression syndrome for which no
      primary treatment exists. Any spinal congenital anomaly may present in adulthood 
      as a consequence of spinal cord tethering and/or development of syringomyelia.

AB  - Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic inflammatory scarring disease
      with a predilection for the anogenital area; however, 15%-20% of LSA cases are
      extragenital. The folliculocentric variant is rarely reported and less well
      understood. The authors report a rare case of extragenital, folliculocentric LSA 
      in a 10-year-old girl. The patient presented to the dermatology clinic for
      evaluation of an asymptomatic eruption of the arms and legs, with no vaginal or
      vulvar involvement. Physical examination revealed the presence of numerous 2-4
      mm, mostly perifollicular, hypopigmented, slightly atrophic papules and plaques. 
      Many of the lesions had a central keratotic plug. Cutaneous histopathological
      examination showed features of LSA. Based on clinical and histological findings, 
      folliculocentric extragenital LSA was diagnosed.

AB  - Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting in
      undermineralization of bone and subsequent skeletal abnormalities. The natural
      history of HPP is characterized by rickets and osteomalacia, increased propensity
      for bone fracture, early loss of teeth in childhood, and muscle weakness. There
      is a wide heterogeneity in disease presentation, and the functional impact of the
      disease can vary from perinatal death to gait abnormalities. Recent clinical
      trials of enzyme replacement therapy have begun to offer an opportunity for
      improvement in survival and function. The role of physical therapy in the
      treatment of the underlying musculoskeletal dysfunction in HPP is
      underrecognized. It is important for physical therapists to understand the
      disease characteristics of the natural history of a rare disease like HPP and how
      the impairment and activity limitations may change in response to medical
      interventions. An understanding of when and how to intervene is also important in
      order to optimally impact body function, lessen structural impairment, and
      facilitate increased functional independence in mobility and activities of daily 
      living. Individualizing treatment to the child's needs, medical fragility, and
      setting (home/school/hospital), while educating parents, caregivers, and school
      staff regarding approved activities and therapy frequency, may improve function
      and development in children with HPP.

TI  - Rate of bleeding-related episodes in adult patients with primary immune
      thrombocytopenia: a retrospective cohort study using a large administrative
      medical claims database in the US.
PG  - 231-9
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S105888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare disorder characterized by low
      platelet counts and an increased tendency to bleed. The goal of ITP therapy is to
      treat or prevent bleeding. Actual rates of bleeding are unknown. Clinical trial
      data may not reflect real-world bleeding rates because of the inclusion of highly
      refractory patients and more frequent use of rescue therapy. METHODS: We used
      administrative medical claims data in the US to examine the occurrence of
      bleeding-related episodes (BREs) - a composite end point including bleeding
      and/or rescue therapy use - in adults diagnosed with primary ITP (2008-2012). BRE
      rates were calculated overall and by ITP phase and splenectomy status. Patients
      were followed from ITP diagnosis until death, disenrollment from the health plan,
      or June 30, 2013, whichever came first. RESULTS: We identified 6,651 adults
      diagnosed with primary ITP over the study period (median age: 53 years; 59%
      female). During 13,064 patient-years of follow-up, 3,768 patients (57%)
      experienced >/=1 BRE (1.08 BREs per patient-year; 95% confidence interval:
      1.06-1.10). The majority (58%) of BREs consisted of rescue therapy use only.
      Common bleeding types were gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, ecchymosis,
      and epistaxis. Intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 74 patients (1%). Just
      over 7% of patients underwent splenectomy. Newly diagnosed and splenectomized
      patients had elevated BRE rates. CONCLUSION: We provide current real-world
      estimates of BRE rates in adults with primary ITP. The majority of ITP patients
      experienced >/=1 BRE, and over half were defined by rescue therapy use alone.
      This demonstrates the importance of examining both bleeding and rescue therapy
      use to fully assess disease burden.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV astrocytoma) is the most common and
      lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with an average survival of slightly more
      than 1 year after initial diagnosis. GBMs display significant heterogeneity
      within the tumor mass, among which a subpopulation of cells called
      glioma-initiating cells (GICs) is responsible for tumorigenesis and resistance to
      conventional therapies. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying the
      biological properties of GICs would help develop better therapies to target this 
      population for GBM treatment. This protocol provides detailed procedures to
      isolate GICs and non-GICs from patient's specimen and glioma xenografts, which
      serves as the first step for the biological studies of GICs. Upon separation of
      GICs and non-GICs, a series of studies, such as expression profiling and
      functional screen, etc., can be performed to identify signal pathways responsible
      for the malignant nature of GICs. Besides, translational studies can also be
      conducted to examine drug responses of GICs. In sum, isolation of GICs with
      reliable methods will provide the basis for the further biological studies.

TI  - Psychiatric manifestations as initial presentation for pediatric CNS germ cell
      tumors, a case series.
PG  - 1359-62
LID - 10.1007/s00381-016-3145-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors account for 3 % of all 
      pediatric brain tumors in the USA. Presenting symptoms are typically location
      based with pineal tumors presenting with obstructive hydrocephalus and
      suprasellar tumors with hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction and ophthalmologic
      abnormalities. Psychiatric manifestations such as psychosis and behavioral
      changes are atypical presentations of CNS germ cell tumors, with only 11
      previously reported cases. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series
      describing patients with CNS germ cell tumors with an atypical presentation
      including psychiatric manifestations. Information regarding clinical
      presentation, treatment course, and outcome were obtained. RESULTS: We report
      seven patients who presented with psychiatric symptoms consisting of psychomotor 
      delay as well as behavioral and mood changes. Six of the seven patients were
      diagnosed >/=6 months after onset of psychiatric symptoms. All of the seven are
      alive but five continue to have neurologic and psychiatric issues post treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentations of CNS germ cell tumors can delay diagnosis
      and treatment and may be secondary to atypical locations as well as endocrine
      dysfunction manifesting as psychiatric symptoms. Delayed diagnosis did not appear
      to affect survival but earlier diagnosis may potentially be associated with
      better neurologic and psychiatric outcome. Patients who present with these
      symptoms and atypical neuroimaging should have a thorough evaluation for CNS germ
      cell tumors including serum and CSF markers. Clinicians should be aware of these 
      less common presentations to aid in prompt diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In renal biopsy reporting, quantitative measurements, such as
      glomerular number and percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli, is central to
      diagnostic accuracy and prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the
      number of glomeruli and percent globally sclerotic in renal biopsies by means of 
      registration of serial tissue sections and manual enumeration, compared to the
      numbers in pathology reports from routine light microscopic assessment. DESIGN:
      We reviewed 277 biopsies from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE)
      digital pathology repository, enumerating 9,379 glomeruli by means of whole slide
      imaging. Glomerular number and the percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli are
      values routinely recorded in the official renal biopsy pathology report from the 
      25 participating centers. Two general trends in reporting were noted: total
      number per biopsy or average number per level/section. Both of these approaches
      were assessed for their accuracy in comparison to the analogous numbers of
      annotated glomeruli on WSI. RESULTS: The number of glomeruli annotated was
      consistently higher than those reported (p<0.001); this difference was
      proportional to the number of glomeruli. In contrast, percent globally sclerotic 
      were similar when calculated on total glomeruli, but greater in FSGS when
      calculated on average number of glomeruli (p<0.01). The difference in percent
      globally sclerotic between annotated and those recorded in pathology reports was 
      significant when global sclerosis is greater than 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      glass slides were not available for direct comparison to whole slide image
      annotation, this study indicates that routine manual light microscopy assessment 
      of number of glomeruli is inaccurate, and the magnitude of this error is
      proportional to the total number of glomeruli.

TI  - Genome-wide imputation study identifies novel HLA locus for pulmonary fibrosis
      and potential role for auto-immunity in fibrotic idiopathic interstitial
      pneumonia.
PG  - 74
LID - 10.1186/s12863-016-0377-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (fIIP) are a group of
      fatal lung diseases with largely unknown etiology and without definitive
      treatment other than lung transplant to prolong life. There is strong evidence
      for the importance of both rare and common genetic risk alleles in familial and
      sporadic disease. We have previously used genome-wide single nucleotide
      polymorphism data to identify 10 risk loci for fIIP. Here we extend that work to 
      imputed genome-wide genotypes and conduct new RNA sequencing studies of lung
      tissue to identify and characterize new fIIP risk loci. RESULTS: We performed
      genome-wide genotype imputation association analyses in 1616 non-Hispanic white
      (NHW) cases and 4683 NHW controls followed by validation and replication (878
      cases, 2017 controls) genotyping and targeted gene expression in lung tissue.
      Following meta-analysis of the discovery and replication populations, we
      identified a novel fIIP locus in the HLA region of chromosome 6 (rs7887 P meta = 
      3.7 x 10(-09)). Imputation of classic HLA alleles identified two in high linkage 
      disequilibrium that are associated with fIIP (DRB1*15:01 P = 1.3 x 10(-7) and
      DQB1*06:02 P = 6.1 x 10(-8)). Targeted RNA-sequencing of the HLA locus identified
      21 genes differentially expressed between fibrotic and control lung tissue (Q <
      0.001), many of which are involved in immune and inflammatory response
      regulation. In addition, the putative risk alleles, DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02,
      are associated with expression of the DQB1 gene among fIIP cases (Q < 1 x
      10(-16)). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a genome-wide significant association
      between the HLA region and fIIP. Two HLA alleles are associated with fIIP and
      affect expression of HLA genes in lung tissue, indicating that the potential
      genetic risk due to HLA alleles may involve gene regulation in addition to
      altered protein structure. These studies reveal the importance of the HLA region 
      for risk of fIIP and a basis for the potential etiologic role of auto-immunity in
      fIIP.

TI  - Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension-A Comparison of Clinical Characteristics
      Between 4 Medical Centers in Different Geographic Regions of the World.
PG  - 280-4
LID - 10.1097/WNO.0000000000000402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a well-characterized
      syndrome, most commonly affecting obese women of childbearing age. Differences in
      its prevalence have been reported in various populations. The aim of this article
      was to determine whether differences in clinical presentation and management
      exist for patients with IIH between different regions the world. METHODS:
      Retrospective database analysis of adult patients with IIH from 4 different
      neuro-ophthalmology clinics. The data collected included gender, age of onset,
      body mass index (BMI), lumbar puncture opening pressure, initial visual acuity
      (VA), initial visual field (VF) mean deviation (MD), pharmacological or surgical 
      treatment, length of follow-up, final VA, and final VF MD. RESULTS: The study
      population consisted of 244 patients, with significant regional variations of
      female to male ratio. Overall, there was no significant difference regarding the 
      age of diagnosis or the BMI. Acetazolamide was the first line of treatment in all
      groups but there was a difference between countries regarding second-line
      treatment, including the use of surgical interventions. Mean initial VA differed 
      between groups but the final change in VA was the same among all the study
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in IIH presentation, treatment, and
      response to therapy among different countries. International prospective studies 
      involving multiple centers are needed to determine the potential influence of
      environmental and genetic factors on the development of IIH and to improve the
      management of this potentially blinding disorder.

AB  - Activation-induced deoxycytidine deaminase (AID) initiates somatic hypermutation 
      (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) by deaminating C-->U during
      transcription of Ig-variable (V) and Ig-switch (S) region DNA, which is essential
      to produce high-affinity antibodies. Here we report the crystal structure of a
      soluble human AID variant at 2.8A resolution that favors targeting WRC motifs
      (W=A/T, R=A/G) in vitro, and executes Ig V SHM in Ramos B-cells. A specificity
      loop extending away from the active site to accommodate two purine bases next to 
      C, differs significantly in sequence, length, and conformation from APOBEC
      proteins Apo3A and Apo3G, which strongly favor pyrimidines at -1 and -2
      positions. Individual amino acid contributions to specificity and processivity
      were measured in relation to a proposed ssDNA binding cleft. This study provides 
      a structural basis for residue contributions to DNA scanning properties unique to
      AID, and for disease mutations in human HIGM-2 syndrome.

TI  - Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis due to PNPLA1 mutation in a golden
      retriever-poodle cross-bred dog and the effect of topical therapy.
PG  - 306-e75
LID - 10.1111/vde.12323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ichthyoses represent a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous
      syndrome of abnormal epidermal cornification. Although the clinical presentation,
      histopathological findings and genetic cause of autosomal recessive congenital
      ichthyosis (ARCI) in golden retriever dogs have been well investigated, the
      optimal management of this disease remains uncharacterized. OBJECTIVES: In this
      report we describe the beneficial effect of oral and topical fatty acids for
      management of a golden retriever and poodle cross-bred dog (goldendoodle) with
      ARCI due to a PNPLA1 (Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 1) mutation.
      CASE REPORT: A six-month-old, intact female, second generation golden retriever
      and poodle cross-bred dog presented with a history of generalized scaling since
      the age of 6 weeks. Histopathology showed diffuse, laminated-to-compact
      hyperkeratosis with a single small perinuclear vacuole in occasional stratum
      granulosum keratinocytes. Genetic testing revealed a homozygotic
      insertion/deletion mutation in the gene PNPLA1. Daily oral fatty acid
      supplementation and humectant rinse, following weekly moisturizing shampoo,
      resulted in only mild improvement after two months. Weekly application of a
      topical essential oils and fatty acid product was then added. Thirteen months
      after the initial presentation the dog exhibited a marked improvement in clinical
      signs. The temporal discontinuation of topical therapy resulted in the worsening 
      of scaling, which improved again after resuming this combination. CONCLUSIONS AND
      CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
      case report of ARCI with homozygous PNPLA1 mutation in a golden retriever-poodle 
      cross-bred dog. The long-term combination of oral fatty acids and topical therapy
      appeared to be beneficial in this case.

TI  - Emerging immunotherapies for glioblastoma.
PG  - 133-45
LID - 10.1080/14728214.2016.1186643 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy for brain cancer has evolved dramatically over the
      past decade, owed in part to our improved understanding of how the immune system 
      interacts with tumors residing within the central nervous system (CNS).
      Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults,
      carries a poor prognosis (<15 months) and only few advances have been made since 
      the FDA's approval of temozolomide (TMZ) in 2005. Importantly, several
      immunotherapies have now entered patient trials based on promising preclinical
      data, and recent studies have shed light on how GBM employs a slew of
      immunosuppressive mechanisms that may be targeted for therapeutic gain.
      Altogether, accumulating evidence suggests immunotherapy may soon earn its keep
      as a mainstay of clinical management for GBM. AREAS COVERED: Here, we review
      cancer vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive T-cell immunotherapy, and
      oncolytic virotherapy. EXPERT OPINION: Checkpoint blockade induces antitumor
      activity by preventing negative regulation of T-cell activation. This platform,
      however, depends on an existing frequency of tumor-reactive T cells. GBM tumors
      are exceptionally equipped to prevent this, occupying low levels of antigen
      expression and elaborate mechanisms of immunosuppression. Therefore, checkpoint
      blockade may be most effective when used in combination with a DC vaccine or
      adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells generated ex vivo. Both approaches 
      have been shown to induce endogenous immune responses against tumor antigens,
      providing a rationale for use with checkpoint blockade where both primary and
      secondary responses may be potentiated.

      glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 1751-6
LID - 10.1177/1535370216648024 [doi]
AB  - Current flow cytometry (FCM) requires fluorescent dyes labeling cells which make 
      the procedure costly and time consuming. This manuscript reports a feasibility
      study of detecting the cell apoptosis with a label-free method in glioblastoma
      cells. A human glioma cell line M059K was exposed to 8 Gy dose of radiation,
      which enables the cells to undergo radiation-induced apoptosis. The rates of
      apoptosis were studied at different time points post-irradiation with two
      different methods: FCM in combination with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and a newly
      developed technique named polarization diffraction imaging flow cytometry.
      Totally 1000 diffraction images were acquired for each sample and the gray level 
      co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) algorithm was used in morphological characterization 
      of the apoptotic cells. Among the feature parameters extracted from each image
      pair, we found that the two GLCM parameters of angular second moment (ASM) and
      sum entropy (SumEnt) exhibit high sensitivities and consistencies as the
      apoptotic rates (Pa) measured with FCM method. In addition, no significant
      difference exists between Pa and ASM_S, Pa and SumEnt_S, respectively (P > 0.05).
      These results demonstrated that the new label-free method can detect cell
      apoptosis effectively. Cells can be directly used in the subsequent biochemical
      experiments as the structure and function of cells and biomolecules are
      well-preserved with this new method.

TI  - Hyper IgM Syndrome: a Report from the USIDNET Registry.
PG  - 490-501
LID - 10.1007/s10875-016-0291-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) patient registry
      was used to characterize the presentation, genetics, phenotypes, and treatment of
      patients with Hyper IgM Syndrome (HIGM). METHODS: The USIDNET Registry was
      queried for HIGM patient data collected from October 1992 to July 2015. Data
      fields included demographics, criteria for diagnosis, pedigree analysis,
      mutations, clinical features, treatment and transplant records, laboratory
      findings, and mortality. RESULTS: Fifty-two physicians entered data from 145
      patients of ages 2 months to 62 years (median 12 years); 131 were males. Using
      patients' age at last entry, data from 2072 patient years are included. Mutations
      were recorded for 85 subjects; 82 were in CD40LG. Eighteen subjects had
      non-X-linked HIGM. 40 % had a normal serum IgM and 15 %, normal IgA. Infections
      were reported for 91 %, with pulmonary, ear, and sinus infections being the most 
      common. 42 % had Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; 6 % had Cryptosporidium. 41 % 
      had neutropenia. 78 % experienced non-infectious complications: chronic diarrhea 
      (n = 22), aphthous ulcers (n = 28), and neoplasms (n = 8) including colon cancer,
      adrenal adenoma, liver adenocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoid, acute myeloid
      leukemia, hepatoma, and, in a female with an autosomal dominant gain of function 
      mutation in PIK3CD, an ovarian dysgerminoma. Thirteen patients had a
      hematopoietic marrow or stem cell transplant; three had solid organ transplants. 
      Thirteen were known to have died (median age = 14 years). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis
      of the USIDNET Registry provides data on the common clinical features of this
      rare syndrome, and in contrast with previously published data, demonstrates
      longer survival times and reduced gastrointestinal manifestations.

AB  - Breast cancer may present with cutaneous symptoms. The skin manifestations of
      breast cancer are varied. Some of the more common clinical presentations of
      metastatic cutaneous lesions from breast cancer will be described. Paraneoplastic
      cutaneous dermatoses have been reported as markers of breast malignancy and
      include erythema gyratum repens, acquired ichthyosis, dermatomyositis,
      multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, and hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita.
      Mammary Paget's disease, often associated with an underlying breast cancer, and
      Cowden syndrome, which has an increased risk of breast malignancy, each have
      specific dermatologic findings. Recognition of these distinct cutaneous signs is 
      important in the investigation of either newly diagnosed or recurrent breast
      cancer.

TI  - Radiolabeled inhibitors as probes for imaging mutant IDH1 expression in gliomas: 
      Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of labeled butyl-phenyl sulfonamide analogs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malignant gliomas frequently harbor mutations in the isocitrate
      dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene. Studies suggest that IDH mutation contributes to
      tumor pathogenesis through mechanisms that are mediated by the neomorphic
      metabolite of the mutant IDH1 enzyme, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The aim of this 
      work was to synthesize and evaluate radiolabeled compounds that bind to the
      mutant IDH1 enzyme with the goal of enabling noninvasive imaging of mutant IDH1
      expression in gliomas by positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: A small
      library of nonradioactive analogs were designed and synthesized based on the
      chemical structure of reported butyl-phenyl sulfonamide inhibitors of mutant
      IDH1. Enzyme inhibition assays were conducted using purified mutant IDH1 enzyme, 
      IDH1-R132H, to determine the IC50 and the maximal inhibitory efficiency of the
      synthesized compounds. Selected compounds, 1 and 4, were labeled with radioiodine
      ((125)I) and/or (18)F using bromo- and phenol precursors, respectively. In vivo
      behavior of the labeled inhibitors was studied by conducting tissue distribution 
      studies with [(125)I]1 in normal mice. Cell uptake studies were conducted using
      an isogenic astrocytoma cell line that carried a native IDH1-R132H mutation to
      evaluate the potential uptake of the labeled inhibitors in IDH1-mutated tumor
      cells. RESULTS: Enzyme inhibition assays showed good inhibitory potency for
      compounds that have iodine or a fluoroethoxy substituent at the ortho position of
      the phenyl ring in compounds 1 and 4 with IC50 values of 1.7 muM and 2.3 muM,
      respectively. Compounds 1 and 4 inhibited mutant IDH1 activity and decreased the 
      production of 2-HG in an IDH1-mutated astrocytoma cell line. Radiolabeling of 1
      and 4 was achieved with an average radiochemical yield of 56.6 +/- 20.1% for
      [(125)I]1 (n = 4) and 67.5 +/- 6.6% for [(18)F]4 (n = 3). [(125)I]1 exhibited
      favorable biodistribution characteristics in normal mice, with rapid clearance
      from the blood and elimination via the hepatobiliary system by 4 h after
      injection. The uptake of [(125)I]1 in tumor cells positive for IDH1-R132H was
      significantly higher compared to isogenic WT-IDH1 controls, with a maximal uptake
      ratio of 1.67 at 3 h post injection. Co-incubation of the labeled inhibitors with
      the corresponding nonradioactive analogs, and decreasing the normal
      concentrations of FBS (10%) in the incubation media substantially increased the
      uptake of the labeled inhibitors in both the IDH1-mutant and WT-IDH1 tumor cell
      lines, suggesting significant non-specific binding of the synthesized labeled
      butyl-phenyl sulfonamide inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the
      feasibility of developing radiolabeled probes for the mutant IDH1 enzyme based on
      enzyme inhibitors. Further optimization of the labeled inhibitors by modifying
      the chemical structure to decrease the lipophilicity and to increase potency may 
      yield compounds with improved characteristics as probes for imaging mutant IDH1
      expression in tumors.

TI  - Selecting SNPs informative for African, American Indian and European Ancestry:
      application to the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND).
PG  - 325
LID - 10.1186/s12864-016-2654-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of population structure in a sample may confound the
      search for important genetic loci associated with disease. Our four samples in
      the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND), European Americans, 
      Mexican Americans, African Americans, and American Indians are part of a genome- 
      wide association study in which population structure might be particularly
      important. We therefore decided to study in detail one component of this,
      individual genetic ancestry (IGA). From SNPs present on the Affymetrix 6.0 Human 
      SNP array, we identified 3 sets of ancestry informative markers (AIMs), each
      maximized for the information in one the three contrasts among ancestral
      populations: Europeans (HAPMAP, CEU), Africans (HAPMAP, YRI and LWK), and Native 
      Americans (full heritage Pima Indians). We estimate IGA and present an algorithm 
      for their standard errors, compare IGA to principal components, emphasize the
      importance of balancing information in the ancestry informative markers (AIMs),
      and test the association of IGA with diabetic nephropathy in the combined sample.
      RESULTS: A fixed parental allele maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to the 
      FIND to estimate IGA in four samples: 869 American Indians; 1385 African
      Americans; 1451 Mexican Americans; and 826 European Americans. When the
      information in the AIMs is unbalanced, the estimates are incorrect with large
      error. Individual genetic admixture is highly correlated with principle
      components for capturing population structure. It takes ~700 SNPs to reduce the
      average standard error of individual admixture below 0.01. When the samples are
      combined, the resulting population structure creates associations between IGA and
      diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: The identified set of AIMs, which include
      American Indian parental allele frequencies, may be particularly useful for
      estimating genetic admixture in populations from the Americas. Failure to balance
      information in maximum likelihood, poly-ancestry models creates biased estimates 
      of individual admixture with large error. This also occurs when estimating IGA
      using the Bayesian clustering method as implemented in the program STRUCTURE.
      Odds ratios for the associations of IGA with disease are consistent with what is 
      known about the incidence and prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in these
      populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the use of temozolomide in chemoradiotherapy is effective,
      the challenging clinical problem of pseudo progression has been raised in brain
      tumor treatment. This study aims to distinguish pseudo progression from true
      progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2012, a total of 161
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with chemoradiotherapy
      at our hospital. Among the patients, 79 had their diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      data acquired at the earliest diagnosed date of pseudo progression or true
      progression, and 23 had both DTI data and genomic data. Clinical records of all
      patients were kept in good condition. Volumetric fractional anisotropy (FA)
      images obtained from the DTI data were decomposed into a sequence of sparse
      representations. Then, a feature selection algorithm was applied to extract the
      critical features from the feature matrix to reduce the size of the feature
      matrix and to improve the classification accuracy. RESULTS: The proposed approach
      was validated using the 79 samples with clinical DTI data. Satisfactory results
      were obtained under different experimental conditions. The area under the
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.87 for a given
      dictionary with 1024 atoms. For the subgroup of 23 samples, genomics data
      analysis was also performed. Results implied further perspective on pseudo
      progression classification. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can determine pseudo
      progression and true progression with improved accuracy. Laboring segmentation is
      no longer necessary because this skillfully designed method is not sensitive to
      tumor location.

TI  - Assessment of early response to tumor-treating fields in newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma using physiologic and metabolic MRI: initial experience.
PG  - 137-44
LID - 10.2217/cns-2016-0003 [doi]
AB  - Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) is a novel antimitotic treatment modality for
      patients with glioblastoma. To assess response to TTFields, a newly diagnosed
      patient with glioblastoma underwent diffusion, perfusion and 3D echo-planar
      spectroscopic imaging prior to initiation of TTFields plus temozolamide
      (baseline) and at 1- and 2-month follow-up periods. Increased mean diffusivity
      along with decreased fractional anisotropy and maximum relative cerebral blood
      volume were noted at 2 months relative to baseline suggesting inhibition of tumor
      growth and angiogenesis. Additionally, a reduction in choline/creatine was also
      noted during this period. These preliminary data indicate the potential of
      physiologic and metabolic MRI in assessing early treatment response to TTFields
      in combination with temozolamide.

TI  - Dominant Splice Site Mutations in PIK3R1 Cause Hyper IgM Syndrome,
      Lymphadenopathy and Short Stature.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1007/s10875-016-0281-6 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this research was to use next generation sequencing to identify
      mutations in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases whose pathogenic
      gene mutations had not been identified. Remarkably, four unrelated patients were 
      found by next generation sequencing to have the same heterozygous mutation in an 
      essential donor splice site of PIK3R1 (NM_181523.2:c.1425 + 1G > A) found in
      three prior reports. All four had the Hyper IgM syndrome, lymphadenopathy and
      short stature, and one also had SHORT syndrome. They were investigated with in
      vitro immune studies, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting studies of the mutation's effect
      on mTOR pathway signaling. All patients had very low percentages of memory B
      cells and class-switched memory B cells and reduced numbers of naive CD4+ and
      CD8+ T cells. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of both an abnormal 273 base-pair
      (bp) size and a normal 399 bp size band in the patient and only the normal band
      was present in the parents. Following anti-CD40 stimulation, patient's EBV-B
      cells displayed higher levels of S6 phosphorylation (mTOR complex 1 dependent
      event), Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (mTOR complex 2 dependent event), and
      Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 (PI3K/PDK1 dependent event) than controls,
      suggesting elevated mTOR signaling downstream of CD40. These observations suggest
      that amino acids 435-474 in PIK3R1 are important for its stability and also its
      ability to restrain PI3K activity. Deletion of Exon 11 leads to constitutive
      activation of PI3K signaling. This is the first report of this mutation and
      immunologic abnormalities in SHORT syndrome.

AB  - Engineered stem cell (SC)-based therapy holds enormous promise for treating the
      incurable brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM). Retaining the cytotoxic SCs in the
      surgical cavity after GBM resection is one of the greatest challenges to this
      approach. Here, we describe a biocompatible electrospun nanofibrous scaffold
      (bENS) implant capable of delivering and retaining tumor-homing cytotoxic stem
      cells that suppress recurrence of post-surgical GBM. As a new approach to GBM
      therapy, we created poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) bENS bearing drug-releasing human
      mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We discovered that bENS-based implant increased
      hMSC retention in the surgical cavity 5-fold and prolonged persistence 3-fold
      compared to standard direct injection using our mouse model of GBM surgical
      resection/recurrence. Time-lapse imaging showed cytotoxic hMSC/bENS treatment
      killed co-cultured human GBM cells, and allowed hMSCs to rapidly migrate off the 
      scaffolds as they homed to GBMs. In vivo, bENS loaded with hMSCs releasing the
      anti-tumor protein TRAIL (bENS(sTR)) reduced the volume of established GBM
      xenografts 3-fold. Mimicking clinical GBM patient therapy, lining the
      post-operative GBM surgical cavity with bENS(sTR) implants inhibited the
      re-growth of residual GBM foci 2.3-fold and prolonged post-surgical median
      survival from 13.5 to 31 days in mice. These results suggest that
      nanofibrous-based SC therapies could be an innovative new approach to improve the
      outcomes of patients suffering from terminal brain cancer.

AB  - Evans syndrome is an underdiagnosed condition consisting of simultaneous or
      sequential combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune-mediated
      thrombocytopenia. We report a case of severe Evans syndrome presenting as altered

TI  - Caffeine inhibits TGFbeta activation in epithelial cells, interrupts fibroblast
      responses to TGFbeta, and reduces established fibrosis in ex vivo precision-cut
      lung slices.
PG  - 565-7
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-208215 [doi]
AB  - Caffeine is a commonly used food additive found naturally in many products. In
      addition to potently stimulating the central nervous system caffeine is able to
      affect various systems within the body including the cardiovascular and
      respiratory systems. Importantly, caffeine is used clinically to treat apnoea and
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature babies. Recently, caffeine has been shown
      to exhibit antifibrotic effects in the liver in part through reducing collagen
      expression and deposition, and reducing expression of the profibrotic cytokine
      TGFbeta. The potential antifibrotic effects of caffeine in the lung have not
      previously been investigated. Using a combined in vitro and ex vivo approach we
      have demonstrated that caffeine can act as an antifibrotic agent in the lung by
      acting on two distinct cell types, namely epithelial cells and fibroblasts.
      Caffeine inhibited TGFbeta activation by lung epithelial cells in a
      concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on TGFbeta activation in
      fibroblasts. Importantly, however, caffeine abrogated profibrotic responses to
      TGFbeta in lung fibroblasts. It inhibited basal expression of the alpha-smooth
      muscle actin gene and reduced TGFbeta-induced increases in profibrotic genes.
      Finally, caffeine reduced established bleomycin-induced fibrosis after 5 days
      treatment in an ex vivo precision-cut lung slice model. Together, these findings 
      suggest that there is merit in further investigating the potential use of
      caffeine, or its analogues, as antifibrotic agents in the lung.

TI  - Additive antiangiogenesis effect of ginsenoside Rg3 with low-dose metronomic
      temozolomide on rat glioma cells both in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s13046-015-0274-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in
      adults. Low-dose,metronomic (LDM) temozolomide (TMZ) displays improved efficacy
      in the treatment of glioblastoma by targeting angiogenesis, but has a limited
      effect on recurrence. The antiangiogenesis drug ginsenoside Rg3 (RG3) is the main
      active ingredient of ginseng, a popular herbal medicine. METHODS: Using an in
      vitro and a rat model of an orthotopic glioma allograft, this study was to
      determine whether RG3 enhanced the antiangiogenesis activity of LDM TMZ in the
      treatment of glioblastoma. RESULTS: Our results showed that combined use of TMZ
      with RG3 displayed additive inhibition on proliferation of both human umbilical
      vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and rat C6 glioma cells in vitro. They additively 
      arrested cell cycle, increased apoptosis, and decreased VEGF-A and BCL-2
      expression in HUVEC. Antiangiogenesis effect was also evaluated in the rat model 
      of orthotopic glioma allograft, based upon markers including relative cerebral
      blood volume (rCBV) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), VEGF levels and
      microvessel density (MVD)/CD34 staining. LDM TMZ alone was potent in suppressing 
      angiogenesis and tumor growth, whereas RG3 alone only had modest antiangiogenesis
      effects. Combined treatment significantly and additively suppressed angiogenesis,
      without additive inhibitory effects on allografted tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS:
      These data provide evidence showing the efficacy of LDM TMZ on glioma treatment. 
      The combined additive antiangiogenesis effect suggests that RG3 has the potential
      to further increase the efficacy of LDM TMZ in the treatment of glioblastoma.

AB  - Abnormal fibrogenic repair response upon alveolar injury is believed to play an
      important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
      PRM-151 (recombinant human pentraxin-2, also known as serum amyloid P), has been 
      shown to reduce fibrosis in preclinical lung fibrosis models, and was well
      tolerated with a favourable pharmacokinetic profile in an earlier single-dose
      phase I study.A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending 
      dose trial was performed to assess the tolerability and pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics of multiple doses of PRM-151 in IPF patients.
      Subjects in three successive cohorts (1, 5, or 10 mg.kg(-1) versus placebo)
      received intravenous study drug on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15, and were followed-up
      to day 57.PRM-151 was well tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious adverse 
      reactions. Administration of PRM-151 resulted in two- to eight-fold
      dose-dependent increases in circulating pentraxin-2 levels. Forced vital capacity
      and 6-min walk test showed trends towards improvement in the combined PRM-151
      dose groups. On high-resolution computed tomography scans, stable or improved
      lung volume unoccupied by interstitial lung abnormality was noted in some PRM-151
      subjects compared to placebo subjects on day 57.The efficacy of PRM-151 in IPF
      remains to be investigated in dedicated future trials.

TI  - Reduced Ets Domain-containing Protein Elk1 Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis via
      Increased Integrin alphavbeta6 Expression.
PG  - 9540-53
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.692368 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with
      high mortality. Active TGFbeta1 is considered central to the pathogenesis of IPF.
      A major mechanism of TGFbeta1 activation in the lung involves the epithelially
      restricted alphavbeta6 integrin. Expression of the alphavbeta6 integrin is
      dramatically increased in IPF. How alphavbeta6 integrin expression is regulated
      in the pulmonary epithelium is unknown. Here we identify a region in the beta6
      subunit gene (ITGB6) promoter acting to markedly repress basal gene
      transcription, which responds to both the Ets domain-containing protein Elk1
      (Elk1) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Both Elk1 and GR can regulate
      alphavbeta6 integrin expression in vitro We demonstrate Elk1 binding to the ITGB6
      promoter basally and that manipulation of Elk1 or Elk1 binding alters ITGB6
      promoter activity, gene transcription, and alphavbeta6 integrin expression.
      Crucially, we find that loss of Elk1 causes enhanced Itgb6 expression and
      exaggerated lung fibrosis in an in vivo model of fibrosis, whereas the GR agonist
      dexamethasone inhibits Itgb6 expression. Moreover, Elk1 dysregulation is present 
      in epithelium from patients with IPF. These data reveal a novel role for Elk1
      regulating ITGB6 expression and highlight how dysregulation of Elk1 can
      contribute to human disease.

PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1097/OGX.0000000000000262 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of congenital heart disease is most commonly reported in 8 per 1000
      live births. Situs anomalies are among the least common forms of congenital heart
      disease. This study defines situs and describes the variations of fetal situs
      anomalies. Situs refers to the arrangement of the viscera, atria, and vessels
      within the body. Situs solitus describes the normal arrangement; situs inversus
      describes inverted arrangement of the viscera and atria; and situs ambiguous
      (also referred to as heterotaxy) describes disturbances in arrangements that can 
      neither be identified as solitus nor inversus. This review will concentrate on
      heterotaxy, as it is the most complicated situs abnormality to define, classify, 
      and study. Prognosis of heterotaxy is variable but most correlated with cardiac
      anatomy. Management is concentrated on numerous cardiac operations and requires a
      multidisciplinary approach to address coexisting congenital anomalies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal obstruction (IO) is a common pediatric surgical emergency 
      in sub-Saharan Africa with high morbidity and mortality, but little is known
      about its etiopathogenesis in Malawi. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients
      seen from February 2012 to June 2014 at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe,
      Malawi (n = 3,407). Pediatric patients with IO were analyzed (n = 130). RESULTS: 
      Overall, 57% of patients were male with a mean age of 3.5 +/- 4.1 years. A total 
      of 52% of patients underwent operative intervention. The overall mortality rate
      was 3%. Leading causes of IO were Hirschprung's 29%, anorectal malformation 18%, 
      and intussusception 4%. Neonates and patients with congenital causes of IO
      underwent surgery less frequently than infants and/or children and patients with 
      acquired causes, respectively. These groups also demonstrated increased number of
      days from admission to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing pediatric-specific
      surgical education and/or training and expanding access to resources may improve 
      mortality after IO in poor medical communities within sub-Saharan Africa.

      therapy for post-surgical cancer.

AB  - Tumor-homing cytotoxic stem cell (SC) therapy is a promising new approach for
      treating the incurable brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM). However, problems of
      retaining cytotoxic SCs within the post-surgical GBM resection cavity are likely 
      to significantly limit the clinical utility of this strategy. Here, we describe a
      new fibrin-based transplant approach capable of increasing cytotoxic SC retention
      and persistence within the resection cavity, yet remaining permissive to
      tumoritropic migration. This fibrin-based transplant can effectively treat both
      solid and post-surgical human GBM in mice. Using our murine model of image-guided
      model of GBM resection, we discovered that suspending human mesenchymal stem
      cells (hMSCS) in a fibrin matrix increased initial retention in the surgical
      resection cavity 2-fold and prolonged persistence in the cavity 3-fold compared
      to conventional delivery strategies. Time-lapse motion analysis revealed that
      cytotoxic hMSCs in the fibrin matrix remain tumoritropic, rapidly migrating from 
      the fibrin matrix to co-localize with cultured human GBM cells. We encapsulated
      hMSCs releasing the cytotoxic agent TRAIL (hMSC-sTR) in fibrin, and found
      hMSC-sTR/fibrin therapy reduced the viability of multiple 3-D human GBM spheroids
      and regressed established human GBM xenografts 3-fold in 11 days. Mimicking
      clinical therapy of surgically resected GBM, intra-cavity seeding of therapeutic 
      hMSC-sTR encapsulated in fibrin reduced post-surgical GBM volumes 6-fold,
      increased time to recurrence 4-fold, and prolonged median survival from 15 to 36 
      days compared to control-treated animals. Fibrin-based SC therapy could represent
      a clinically compatible, viable treatment to suppress recurrence of post-surgical
      GBM and other lethal cancer types.

AB  - Cerebellar abnormalities are encountered in a high number of neurological
      diseases that present in the neonatal period. These disorders can be categorized 
      broadly as inherited (e.g. malformations, inborn errors of metabolism) or
      acquired (e.g. hemorrhages, infections, stroke). In some disorders such as
      Dandy-Walker malformation or Joubert syndrome, the main abnormalities are located
      within the cerebellum and brainstem. In other disorders such as Krabbe disease or
      sulfite oxidase deficiency, the main abnormalities are found within the
      supratentorial brain, but the cerebellar involvement may be helpful for
      diagnostic purposes. In In this article, we review neurological disorders with
      onset in the neonatal period and cerebellar involvement with a focus on how
      characterization of cerebellar involvement can facilitate accurate diagnosis and 
      improved accuracy of neuro-functional prognosis.

TI  - Serum elevation of B lymphocyte stimulator does not increase regulatory B cells
      in glioblastoma patients undergoing immunotherapy.
PG  - 205-11
LID - 10.1007/s00262-015-1784-3 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory B cells that secrete IL-10 (IL-10(+) Bregs) represent a suppressive
      subset of the B cell compartment with prominent anti-inflammatory capacity,
      capable of suppressing cellular and humoral responses to cancer and vaccines. B
      lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a key regulatory molecule in IL-10(+) Breg
      biology with tightly controlled serum levels. However, BLyS levels can be
      drastically altered upon chemotherapeutic intervention. We have previously shown 
      that serum BLyS levels are elevated, and directly associated, with increased
      antigen-specific antibody titers in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing
      lymphodepletive temozolomide chemotherapy and vaccination. In this study, we
      examined corresponding IL-10(+) Breg responses within this patient population and
      demonstrate that the IL-10(+) Breg compartment remains constant before and after 
      administration of the vaccine, despite elevated BLyS levels in circulation.
      IL-10(+) Breg frequencies were not associated with serum BLyS levels, and ex vivo
      stimulation with a physiologically relevant concentration of BLyS did not
      increase IL-10(+) Breg frequency. However, BLyS stimulation did increase the
      frequency of the overall B cell compartment and promoted B cell proliferation
      upon B cell receptor engagement. Therefore, using BLyS as an adjuvant with
      therapeutic peptide vaccination could promote humoral immunity with no increase
      in immunosuppressive IL-10(+) Bregs. These results have implications for
      modulating humoral responses in human peptide vaccine trials in patients with
      GBM.

TI  - Disruption of CXCR4 signaling in pharyngeal neural crest cells causes DiGeorge
      syndrome-like malformations.
PG  - 582-8
LID - 10.1242/dev.126573 [doi]
AB  - DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is a congenital disease causing cardiac outflow tract
      anomalies, craniofacial dysmorphogenesis, thymus hypoplasia, and mental
      disorders. It results from defective development of neural crest cells (NCs) that
      colonize the pharyngeal arches and contribute to lower jaw, neck and heart
      tissues. Although TBX1 has been identified as the main gene accounting for the
      defects observed in human patients and mouse models, the molecular mechanisms
      underlying DGS etiology are poorly identified. The recent demonstrations that the
      SDF1/CXCR4 axis is implicated in NC chemotactic guidance and impaired in cortical
      interneurons of mouse DGS models prompted us to search for genetic interactions
      between Tbx1, Sdf1 (Cxcl12) and Cxcr4 in pharyngeal NCs and to investigate the
      effect of altering CXCR4 signaling on the ontogeny of their derivatives, which
      are affected in DGS. Here, we provide evidence that Cxcr4 and Sdf1 are
      genetically downstream of Tbx1 during pharyngeal NC development and that
      reduction of CXCR4 signaling causes misrouting of pharyngeal NCs in chick and
      dramatic morphological alterations in the mandibular skeleton, thymus and cranial
      sensory ganglia. Our results therefore support the possibility of a pivotal role 
      for the SDF1/CXCR4 axis in DGS etiology.

      dysfunction 2years later among children born before the 28th week of gestation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation during the first two postnatal weeks in
      extremely preterm newborns (<28weeks gestation) has been associated with an
      increased risk of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. Little is known, however,
      about the relationship between systemic inflammation during the third and fourth 
      postnatal weeks and subsequent development. METHODS: We measured the
      concentrations of 16 inflammation-related proteins in blood spots collected on
      postnatal days 21 (N=749) and 28 (N=697) from infants born before the 28th week
      of gestation and assessed at age 2years. We then sought the developmental
      correlates of top quartile concentrations for gestational age and day the
      specimen was collected. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated 
      from regular or multinomial logistic regression models (as appropriate). RESULTS:
      Top quartile concentrations of CRP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-6R, TNF-R2, IL-8, ICAM-1, 
      and TSH on both days 21 and 28 were associated with ventriculomegaly (when in the
      NICU) and microcephaly at age 2years. Top quartile concentrations of CRP, SAA,
      IL-6, TNF-R2, IL-8, and ICAM-1 were associated with mental development index
      (MDI) of the Bayley-II<55, while top quartile concentrations of CRP, TNF-alpha
      (inversely), IL-8, and ICAM-1 were associated with psychomotor development index 
      (PDI)<55 CONCLUSION: Extremely preterm newborns who had systemic inflammation
      during the third and fourth postnatal weeks were at increased risk of
      ventriculomegaly during the months after birth, and of microcephaly, and low
      Bayley Scale scores at 2years old.

TI  - Evaluation of a DLA-79 allele associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases
      in dogs.
PG  - 205-17
LID - 10.1007/s00251-015-0894-6 [doi]
AB  - Immune-mediated diseases are common and life-threatening disorders in dogs. Many 
      canine immune-mediated diseases have strong breed predispositions and are
      believed to be inherited. However, the genetic mutations that cause these
      diseases are mostly unknown. As many immune-mediated diseases in humans share
      polymorphisms among a common set of genes, we conducted a candidate gene study of
      15 of these genes across four immune-mediated diseases (immune-mediated hemolytic
      anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA),
      and atopic dermatitis) in 195 affected and 206 unaffected dogs to assess whether 
      causative or predictive polymorphisms might exist in similar genes in dogs. We
      demonstrate a strong association (Fisher's exact p = 0.0004 for allelic
      association, p = 0.0035 for genotypic association) between two polymorphic
      positions (10 bp apart) in exon 2 of one allele in DLA-79, DLA-79*001:02, and
      multiple immune-mediated diseases. The frequency of this allele was significantly
      higher in dogs with immune-mediated disease than in control dogs (0.21 vs. 0.12) 
      and ranged from 0.28 in dogs with IMPA to 0.15 in dogs with atopic dermatitis.
      This allele has two non-synonymous substitutions (compared with the reference
      allele, DLA-79*001:01), resulting in F33L and N37D amino acid changes. These
      mutations occur in the peptide-binding pocket of the protein, and based upon our 
      computational modeling studies, are likely to affect critical interactions with
      the peptide N-terminus. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings
      more broadly and to determine the specific mechanism by which the identified
      variants alter canine immune system function.

TI  - Eltrombopag for the treatment of children with persistent and chronic immune
      thrombocytopenia (PETIT): a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - e315-25

AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag is approved for 
      treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. In the PETIT trial, we 
      aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in children with
      persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia. METHODS: PETIT was a three-part,
      randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled study done at 22 centres in the USA, 
      UK, Canada, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. Patients aged 1-17 years with
      immune thrombocytopenia lasting for 6 months or longer and platelets less than 30
      x 10(9) per L who had received at least one previous treatment were enrolled. We 
      enrolled patients into three cohorts consisting of patients aged 12-17, 6-11, and
      1-5 years. We established patients' starting doses with an open-label,
      dose-finding phase with five patients in each cohort. During the dose-finding
      phase, patients aged 6-17 years started eltrombopag at 25 mg once per day (12.5
      mg for those weighing <27 kg) and patients aged 1-5 years received 0.7 mg/kg per 
      day to a maximum of 2 mg/kg unless otherwise approved. We permitted dose
      adjustments on the basis of platelet response up to a maximum dosage of 75 mg per
      day. Additional patients were then recruited and randomly assigned (2:1) to
      receive either eltrombopag or placebo tablets (or oral suspension formulation if 
      aged 1-5 years) once per day for 7 weeks at the previously established doses.
      Starting doses for the double-blind phase were 37.5 mg/day for patients aged
      12-17 years; 50 mg/day for patients weighing 27 kg or more (25 mg for east Asian 
      patients) and 25 mg/day for patients weighing less than 27 kg (12.5 mg once per
      day for east Asian patients) for patients aged 6-11 years; and 1.5 mg/kg once per
      day (0.8 mg/kg once per day for east Asian patients) for patients aged 1-5 years.
      Randomisation was done by the GlaxoSmithKline Registration/Medication Ordering
      System and both patients and study personnel were masked to treatment
      assignments. Patients who completed treatment were then enrolled into an
      open-label phase and all patients could receive up to 24 weeks of eltrombopag.
      The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a platelet count of 
      50 x 10(9) per L or more at least once from weeks 1-6 (days 8 to 43) of the
      randomised phase of the study in the absence of rescue therapy. We assessed
      efficacy in the intent-to-treat population, which consisted of all patients
      assigned to treatment, and we assessed safety in all patients who received at
      least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00908037. FINDINGS: Between Oct 2, 2009, and June
      22, 2011, we recruited 15 patients, with five patients in each age cohort, into
      the open-label dose-finding phase who did not progress into the double-blind
      phase. From March 17, 2010, to Jan 15, 2013, we randomly assigned 67 patients to 
      treatment, with 45 patients assigned to receive eltrombopag (16 children aged
      12-17 years, 19 aged 6-11 years, and ten aged 1-5 years) and 22 to receive
      placebo (eight children aged 12-17 years, nine aged 6-11 years, and five aged 1-5
      years). However, two patients assigned to receive eltrombopag did not receive the
      study drug and one was lost to follow-up, and one patient assigned to receive
      placebo was given eltrombopag. From weeks 1 to 6, 28 (62%) patients who received 
      eltrombopag, compared with seven (32%) who received placebo, achieved the primary
      endpoint of platelet count 50 x 10(9) per L or more at least once without rescue 
      (odds ratio 4.31, 95% CI 1.39-13.34, p=0.011). The most common adverse events
      with eltrombopag were headache (13 [30%] patients receiving eltrombopag vs nine
      [43%] patients receiving placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (11 [25%]
      patients vs two [10%] patients), and diarrhoea (seven [16%] patients vs one [5%] 
      patient). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in five (11%) patients receiving
      eltrombopag and four (19%) patients receiving placebo, and serious adverse events
      (four [9%] patients receiving eltrombopag and two (10%) patients receiving
      placebo) were similarly infrequent in both groups. No thrombotic events or
      malignancies occurred. Increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations caused
      two (3%) of 65 patients to discontinue eltrombopag in the open-label phase.
      INTERPRETATION: Our results showed that eltrombopag could be used to increase
      platelet counts and reduce clinically significant bleeding in children with
      persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Prevalence of increased liver
      laboratory values was similar to that seen in adults. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.

AB  - Pneumocele is a condition involving the pathologic expansion of paranasal sinuses
      with corresponding bony erosion of the skull base. Extensive pneumocele can lead 
      to pneumocephalus, especially in patients with long-term cerebrospinal fluid
      shunts. Here, the authors present a case of pneumocele in an adult with a history
      of congenital hydrocephalus managed with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The
      patient underwent reconstruction of a posterior table defect with a pericranial
      flap followed by frontal sinus obliteration with abdominal fat.

TI  - Adult patients with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma: long-term follow-up of 
      prospective multicenter clinical trial NCCTG-867251 (Alliance).
PG  - 199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a rare tumor in adults. This report is of a 
      prospective clinical trial with long-term follow-up. METHODS: Between 1986 and
      1994, 20 eligible adults with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas were enrolled
      in a prospective intergroup trial of radiotherapy (RT) after biopsy (3 patients) 
      or observation after gross (11 patients) or subtotal (6 patients) resection.
      RESULTS: At the time of analysis (median follow-up, 20.8 years), 2 patients (10%)
      have died and 18 patients (90%) are alive. Neurologic and cognitive function were
      stable or improved over time for the majority of patients. No toxic effects of
      treatment or malignant transformations have been recorded at last follow-up. For 
      the entire cohort the 20-year time to progression and overall survival rates are 
      95% and 90% respectively. The cause of death (2.2 and 16.1 years after
      enrollment) in both patients was unrelated to tumor although both were
      biopsy-only patients. One subtotally resected tumor progressed 1 month after
      enrollment requiring P(32) injection into an enlarging cyst. Because of further
      progression this patient required RT 18 months later. This patient is alive
      without evidence of progression 18 years after RT. CONCLUSION: The long-term
      follow-up results of this prospective trial confirm that adults with pilocytic
      astrocytomas have a favorable prognosis with regard to survival and neurologic
      function. Close observation is recommended for adults with pilocytic
      astrocytomas, reserving RT for salvage, as the majority remain stable after gross
      or subtotal resection and no adjuvant therapy.

LID - 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000340 [doi]
AB  - We aim to review the magnetic resonance imaging appearance of malformations of
      midbrain and hindbrain. These can be classified as predominantly cerebellar
      malformations, combined cerebellar and brain stem malformations, and
      predominantly brain stem malformations. The diagnostic criteria for the majority 
      of these morphological malformations are based on neuroimaging findings. The
      predominantly cerebellar malformations include predominantly vermian hypoplasia
      seen in Dandy-Walker malformation and rhombencephalosynapsis, global cerebellar
      hypoplasia reported in lissencephaly and microlissencephaly, and unilateral

AB  - Treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is especially challenging due to a
      shortage of methods to preferentially target diffuse infiltrative cells, and
      therapy-resistant glioma stem cell populations. Here we report a physical
      treatment method based on electrical disruption of cells, whose action depends
      strongly on cellular morphology. Interestingly, numerical modeling suggests that 
      while outer lipid bilayer disruption induced by long pulses (~100 mus) is
      enhanced for larger cells, short pulses (~1 mus) preferentially result in high
      fields within the cell interior, which scale in magnitude with nucleus size.
      Because enlarged nuclei represent a reliable indicator of malignancy, this
      suggested a means of preferentially targeting malignant cells. While we
      demonstrate killing of both normal and malignant cells using pulsed electric
      fields (PEFs) to treat spontaneous canine GBM, we proposed that properly tuned
      PEFs might provide targeted ablation based on nuclear size. Using 3D hydrogel
      models of normal and malignant brain tissues, which permit high-resolution
      interrogation during treatment testing, we confirmed that PEFs could be tuned to 
      preferentially kill cancerous cells. Finally, we estimated the nuclear envelope
      electric potential disruption needed for cell death from PEFs. Our results may be
      useful in safely targeting the therapy-resistant cell niches that cause
      recurrence of GBM tumors.

TI  - Communication of Psychiatric Risk in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: A Pilot Project.
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.1007/s10897-015-9910-0 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) have an increased chance
      of developing a psychiatric disorder. While parents of children affected by
      22q11.2DS typically receive counseling about risk for non-psychiatric health
      concerns, genetic counselors may be reluctant to discuss psychiatric risk.
      Further education of genetic counselors may be necessary to encourage discussion 
      of psychiatric risk with these families. The goal of this project was to develop 
      recommendations for genetic counselors to provide psychiatric risk information to
      families affected by 22q11.2DS. The recommendations were developed by
      synthesizing resources in the literature about risk communication. These
      recommendations were refined following an online focus group meeting with five
      health care professionals who were recruited for participation from 22q11.2DS
      clinics across the U.S.A. The focus group data revealed three themes related to
      discussion of psychiatric risk: 1) Stepwise approach, 2) Discussing treatment
      options and reducing risks, and 3) Addressing stigma. These recommendations may
      be used as a foundation for a future clinical protocol to encourage discussion
      about the risk for psychiatric illness at an earlier point in the diagnostic
      process for 22q11.2DS and to provide improved information, support and resources 
      to affected families.

TI  - GO-PCA: An Unsupervised Method to Explore Gene Expression Data Using Prior
      Knowledge.
PG  - e0143196
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0143196 [doi]
AB  - METHOD: Genome-wide expression profiling is a widely used approach for
      characterizing heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other
      biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such data typically relies on
      generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis (PCA) or
      hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit prior knowledge
      about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an unsupervised
      method that combines PCA with nonparametric GO enrichment analysis, in order to
      systematically search for sets of genes that are both strongly correlated and
      closely functionally related. These gene sets are then used to automatically
      generate expression signatures with functional labels, which collectively aim to 
      provide a readily interpretable representation of biologically relevant
      similarities and differences. The robustness of the results obtained can be
      assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: I first applied GO-PCA to datasets containing
      diverse hematopoietic cell types from human and mouse, respectively. In both
      cases, GO-PCA generated a small number of signatures that represented the
      majority of lineages present, and whose labels reflected their respective
      biological characteristics. I then applied GO-PCA to human glioblastoma (GBM)
      data, and recovered signatures associated with four out of five previously
      defined GBM subtypes. My results demonstrate that GO-PCA is a powerful and
      versatile exploratory method that reduces an expression matrix containing
      thousands of genes to a much smaller set of interpretable signatures. In this
      way, GO-PCA aims to facilitate hypothesis generation, design of further analyses,
      and functional comparisons across datasets.

TI  - miR-1343 attenuates pathways of fibrosis by targeting the TGF-beta receptors.
PG  - 245-56
LID - 10.1042/BJ20150821 [doi]
AB  - Irreversible respiratory obstruction resulting from progressive airway damage,
      inflammation and fibrosis is a feature of several chronic respiratory diseases,
      including cystic fibrosis (CF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cytokine transforming growth factor
      beta (TGF-beta) has a pivotal role in promoting lung fibrosis and is implicated
      in respiratory disease severity. In the present study, we show that a previously 
      uncharacterized miRNA, miR-1343, reduces the expression of both TGF-beta receptor
      1 and 2 by directly targeting their 3'-UTRs. After TGF-beta exposure, elevated
      intracellular miR-1343 significantly decreases levels of activated TGF-beta
      effector molecules, pSMAD2 (phosphorylated SMAD2) and pSMAD3 (phosphorylated
      SMAD3), when compared with a non-targeting control miRNA. As a result, the
      abundance of fibrotic markers is reduced, cell migration into a scratch wound
      impaired and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) repressed. Mature
      miR-1343 is readily detected in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells and is
      activated in response to stress in A549 lung epithelial cells. miR-1343 may have 
      direct therapeutic applications in fibrotic lung disease.

TI  - Factors affecting Fontan length of stay: Results from the Single Ventricle
      Reconstruction trial.

LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.09.061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial, infants with
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who received a
      right-ventricle-to-pulmonary-artery shunt (RVPAS) versus a modified
      Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) had lower early postoperative mortality, but more
      complications at 14 months. We explored the effect of shunt type and other
      patient, medical, and surgical factors on postoperative length of stay (LOS)
      after the Fontan operation. METHODS: Fontan postoperative course was ascertained 
      from medical record review. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to
      identify factors associated with LOS. RESULTS: Of 327 subjects who underwent
      Fontan, 323 were analyzed (1 death, 1 biventricular repair, 2 with missing data).
      Median age and weight at Fontan were 2.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.3,
      3.4) and 12.7 kg (IQR: 11.4, 14.1), respectively. Fontan type was extracardiac in
      55% and lateral tunnel in 45%; 87% were fenestrated. The RVPAS and MBTS subjects 
      had similar LOS (median 11 days [IQR: 9, 18] vs 10 days [IQR: 9, 13]; P = .23).
      Independent risk factors for longer LOS were treatment center (P < .01), LOS at
      stage II (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02 for each additional day; P < .01), and
      pre-Fontan complications (HR 1.03 for each additional complication; P = .04). Use
      of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest at Fontan (HR 0.64; P = .02) was
      independently associated with shorter LOS. When center was excluded from the
      model, pre-Fontan complications and use of circulatory arrest were no longer
      significant; instead, older age at stage II (HR 1.08 for each additional month; P
      = .01) predicted longer LOS. In 254 subjects who had a pre-Fontan echocardiogram,
      at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation was independently associated with
      longer LOS, both with center (HR 1.72; P < .01) and without center in the model
      (HR 1.49; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter prospective cohort of
      subjects with HLHS, Norwood shunt type was not associated with Fontan LOS.
      Rather, global measures of earlier medical complexity indicate greater likelihood
      of longer LOS after the Fontan operation.

TI  - Factors Associated with Travel Time and Distance to Access Hospital Care Among
      Infants with Spina Bifida.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Using geographic information systems (GIS), we examined travel time
      and distance to access hospital care for infants with spina bifida (SB). METHODS:
      This study was a statewide, population-based analysis of Florida-born children
      with SB, 1998-2007, identified by the Florida Birth Defects Registry and linked
      to hospitalizations. We geocoded maternal residence at delivery and identified
      hospital locations for infants (<1 year). Using 2007 Florida Department of
      Transportation road data, we calculated one-way mean travel time and distance to 
      access hospital care. We used Poisson regression to examine selected factors
      associated with travel time and distance [</=30 vs. >30 min/miles (reference)],
      including presence of hydrocephalus and SB type [isolated (no other major birth
      defect) versus non-isolated SB]. RESULTS: For 612 infants, one-way mean (median) 
      travel time was 45.1 (25.9) min. Infants with both non-isolated SB and
      hydrocephalus traveled longest to access hospitals (mean 60.8 min/48.5 miles;
      median 34.2 min/26.9 miles). In adjusted results, infants with non-isolated SB
      and whose mothers had a rural residence were less likely to travel </=30 min to
      hospitals. Infants born to mothers in minority racial/ethnic groups were more
      likely to travel </=30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Birth defects registry data and
      GIS-based methods can be used to evaluate geographic accessibility to hospital
      care for infants with birth defects. Results can help to identify geographic
      barriers to accessing hospital care, such as travel time and distance, and inform
      opportunities to improve access to care for infants with SB or other special
      needs.

TI  - Joubert Syndrome in French Canadians and Identification of Mutations in CEP104.

AB  - Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a primarily autosomal-recessive disorder characterized
      by a distinctive mid-hindbrain and cerebellar malformation, oculomotor apraxia,
      irregular breathing, developmental delay, and ataxia. JBTS is a genetically
      heterogeneous ciliopathy. We sought to characterize the genetic landscape
      associated with JBTS in the French Canadian (FC) population. We studied 43 FC
      JBTS subjects from 35 families by combining targeted and exome sequencing. We
      identified pathogenic (n = 32 families) or possibly pathogenic (n = 2 families)
      variants in genes previously associated with JBTS in all of these subjects,
      except for one. In the latter case, we found a homozygous splice-site mutation
      (c.735+2T>C) in CEP104. Interestingly, we identified two additional non-FC JBTS
      subjects with mutations in CEP104; one of these subjects harbors a maternally
      inherited nonsense mutation (c.496C>T [p.Arg166*]) and a de novo splice-site
      mutation (c.2572-2A>G), whereas the other bears a homozygous frameshift mutation 
      (c.1328_1329insT [p.Tyr444fs*3]) in CEP104. Previous studies have shown that
      CEP104 moves from the mother centriole to the tip of the primary cilium during
      ciliogenesis. Knockdown of CEP104 in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells
      resulted in severe defects in ciliogenesis. These observations suggest that
      CEP104 acts early during cilia formation by regulating the conversion of the
      mother centriole into the cilia basal body. We conclude that disruption of CEP104
      causes JBTS. Our study also reveals that the cause of JBTS has been elucidated in
      the great majority of our FC subjects (33/35 [94%] families), even though JBTS
      shows substantial locus and allelic heterogeneity in this population.

TI  - The use of dual growing rods to correct spinal deformity secondary to a low-grade
      spinal cord astrocytoma.
LID - 10.1093/jscr/rjv128 [doi]
LID - rjv128 [pii]
AB  - Pediatric intramedullary spinal cord astrocytomas are rare, and the majority are 
      low grade, typically carrying a low risk of mortality, but a high risk of
      morbidity. Quality of life is, therefore, an important consideration in treating 
      concomitant progressive kyphoscoliosis. Compared with fusion-based spinal
      stabilization, fusionless techniques may limit some complications related to
      early instrumentation of the developing spine. Another consideration is the
      timing of radiation therapy relative to both spinal maturity and spinal
      instrumentation. To date, there have been no reports of the use of a fusionless
      technique to treat spinal deformity secondary to an intramedullary spinal cord
      tumor. Herein, we report the use of fusionless spinal stabilization with dual
      growing rods in a boy with low-grade spinal cord astrocytoma after radiation
      therapy.

TI  - Ultraviolet phototherapy for cutaneous diseases: a concise review.
PG  - 253-9
LID - 10.1111/odi.12366 [doi]
AB  - Phototherapy is the use of non-ionizing radiation, primarily in the ultraviolet
      spectrum, to treat disease. In dermatology, ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy remains
      an established, lower cost, and often preferred option for many common skin
      conditions, despite the introduction of newer potent biologics. This article
      introduces a principal therapeutic modality in the treatment of psoriasis, atopic
      dermatitis (eczema), vitiligo, and morphea among other diseases where oral
      manifestations may be present, providing basic information about the use of UVA, 
      UVB, and PUVA. Practical considerations and side effects of phototherapy are
      described. Phototherapy is an effective treatment for many illnesses and carries 
      a relatively benign side-effect profile.

TI  - The genomic landscape of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
PG  - 1326-1333
LID - 10.1038/ng.3400 [doi]
AB  - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) of
      childhood with a poor prognosis. Mutations in NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11 or CBL
      occur in 85% of patients, yet there are currently no risk stratification
      algorithms capable of predicting which patients will be refractory to
      conventional treatment and could therefore be candidates for experimental
      therapies. In addition, few molecular pathways aside from the RAS-MAPK pathway
      have been identified that could serve as the basis for such novel therapeutic
      strategies. We therefore sought to genomically characterize serial samples from
      patients at diagnosis through relapse and transformation to acute myeloid
      leukemia to expand knowledge of the mutational spectrum in JMML. We identified
      recurrent mutations in genes involved in signal transduction, splicing, Polycomb 
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and transcription. Notably, the number of somatic
      alterations present at diagnosis appears to be the major determinant of outcome.

TI  - Esophageal Dysmotility, Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease, and Lung
      Transplantation: What Is the Evidence?
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1007/s11894-015-0474-9 [doi]
AB  - Lung transplantation is an effective and life-prolonging therapy for patients
      with advanced lung disease (ALD). However, long-term patient survival following
      lung transplantation is primarily limited by development of an inflammatory and
      fibrotic process involving the lung allograft known as bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome (BOS). Although the precise cause of BOS remains uncertain and is likely
      multifactorial, chronic aspiration of gastro-duodenal contents is one possible
      contributing factor. Multiple small, cross-sectional studies performed over the
      past two decades have reported a high prevalence of gastro-esophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) and esophageal dysmotility in the ALD population and several
      investigations suggest the prevalence may increase following lung
      transplantation. More recent studies evaluating the direct effect of
      gastro-duodenal contents on airways have demonstrated a possible biologic link
      between GERD and BOS. Despite the recent advances in our understanding of BOS,
      further investigations are needed to establish GERD as a causative factor in its 
      development. This review will discuss the existing literature that has identified
      an association of GERD with ALD and post-transplant populations, with a focus on 
      recent advances in the field.

TI  - Redox-Active Mn Porphyrin-based Potent SOD Mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP(5+), Enhances
      Carbenoxolone-Mediated TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Multiforme.
PG  - 140-55
LID - 10.1007/s12015-015-9628-2 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant tumor of the brain and is
      challenging to treat due to its highly invasive nature and heterogeneity.
      Malignant brain tumor displays high metabolic activity which perturbs its redox
      environment and in turn translates to high oxidative stress. Thus, pushing the
      oxidative stress level to achieve the maximum tolerable threshold that induces
      cell death is a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Previously, we have shown 
      that gap junction inhibitor, carbenoxolone (CBX), is capable of enhancing tumor
      necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis in
      glioma cells. Since CBX is known to induce oxidative stress, we hypothesized that
      the addition of another potent mediator of oxidative stress, powerful SOD mimic
      MnTnBuOE-2-PyP(5+) (MnBuOE), could further enhance TRAIL-driven therapeutic
      efficacy in glioma cells. Our results showed that combining TRAIL + CBX with
      MnBuOE significantly enhances cell death of glioma cell lines and this
      enhancement could be further potentiated by CBX pretreatment. MnBuOE-driven
      cytotoxicity is due to its ability to take advantage of oxidative stress imposed 
      by CBX + TRAIL system, and enhance it in the presence of endogenous reductants,
      ascorbate and thiol, thereby producing cytotoxic H2O2, and in turn inducing death
      of glioma cells but not normal astrocytes. Most importantly, combination
      treatment significantly reduces viability of TRAIL-resistant Asian
      patient-derived glioma cells, thus demonstrating the potential clinical use of
      our therapeutic system. It was reported that H2O2 is involved in membrane
      depolarization-based sensitization of cancer cells toward TRAIL. MnBuOE is
      entering Clinical Trials as a normal brain radioprotector in glioma patients at
      Duke University increasing Clinical relevance of our studies.

TI  - Endocrine hypertension: An overview on the current etiopathogenesis and
      management options.
PG  - 14-27
AB  - Endocrine causes of secondary hypertension include primary aldosteronism,
      pheochromocytoma, cushing's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism and hypo- and
      hyperthyroidism. They comprise of the 5%-10% of the causes of secondary
      hypertension. Primary hyperaldosteronism, the most common of the endocrine cause 
      of hypertension often presents with resistant or difficult to control
      hypertension associated with either normo-or hypokalemia. Pheochromocytoma, the
      great mimicker of many conditions, is associated with high morbidity and
      mortality if left untreated. A complete history including pertinent family
      history, physical examination along with a high index of suspicion with focused
      biochemical and radiological evaluation is important to diagnose and effectively 
      treat these conditions. The cost effective targeted genetic screening for current
      known mutations associated with pheochromocytoma are important for early
      diagnosis and management in family members. The current review focuses on the
      most recent evidence regarding causes, clinical features, methods of diagnosis,
      and management of these conditions. A multidisciplinary approach involving
      internists, endocrinologists and surgeons is recommended in optimal management of
      these conditions.

TI  - Potassium Disorders: Hypokalemia and Hyperkalemia.
PG  - 487-95
AB  - Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes
      in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and
      gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease,
      hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe,
      potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances 
      and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the
      need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination,
      laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment
      include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in
      potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain
      comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium.
      To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered
      to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with 
      concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels 
      in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute
      treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of
      transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium 
      disturbances.

TI  - Psychosocial Predictors of Mortality Following Lung Transplantation.
PG  - 271-7
LID - 10.1111/ajt.13447 [doi]
AB  - Lung transplantation has become an increasingly common treatment for patients
      with end-stage lung disease. Few studies have examined psychosocial risk factors 
      for mortality in transplant recipients, despite evidence suggesting that elevated
      levels of negative affect are associated with greater mortality following major
      cardiac surgery. We therefore examined the relationship between negative affect
      early after lung transplantation and long-term survival in a sample of 132 lung
      transplant recipients (28 cystic fibrosis, 64 chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, 26 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 14 other) followed for up to 13.5
      years (median 7.4 years) following transplantation. Patients underwent both
      medical and psychosocial assessments 6 months following transplantation, which
      included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Spielberger Anxiety
      Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Over the course of follow-up, 
      80 (61%) participants died. Controlling for demographic factors, native lung
      disease, disease severity, family income, education level, social support, and
      frequency of posttransplant rejection, elevated symptoms of depression (BDI-II:
      HR = 1.31, p = 0.011) and distress (GHQ: HR = 1.28, p = 0.003) were associated
      with increased mortality. Higher levels of depression and general distress, but
      not anxiety, measured 6 months following lung transplantation are associated with
      increased mortality, independent of background characteristics and medical
      predictors.

      placenta among children born before the 28th week of gestation.
PG  - e7-11
LID - 10.1111/apa.13174 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between placenta corticotropin-releasing
      hormone (CRH) expression and brain structure and function abnormalities in
      extremely preterm newborns. METHODS: In a sample of 1243 infants born before the 
      28th week of gestation, we evaluated the relationship between CRH expression in
      the placenta and the risk of brain ultrasound scan abnormalities identified while
      these infants were in the intensive care nursery, low scores on the Bayley Scales
      of Infant Development-II of 900 of these children at age two years and head
      circumference measurements then more than one and two standard deviations below
      the mean. RESULTS: Infants who had a low placenta CRH messenger ribonucleic acid 
      (mRNA) concentration were at increased risk of ventriculomegaly on an ultrasound 
      scan. An elevated placenta CRH mRNA concentration was associated with increased
      risk of an inability to walk at age two years, and a Bayley Motor Scale 3
      standard deviations below the mean. CONCLUSION: Placenta CRH mRNA concentration
      appears to convey information about the risk of brain damage in the infant born
      at an extremely low gestational age.

      median overall survival time is only approximately 15-17 months, because the
      tumour recurs in virtually all patients, and no commonly accepted standard
      treatment for recurrent disease exists. Several targeted agents have failed to
      improve patient outcomes in glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab has provided relevant
      clinical improvements in other advanced tumours for which conventional therapies 
      have had limited success, making immunotherapy an appealing strategy in
      glioblastoma. This Review summarizes current knowledge on immune checkpoint
      modulators and evaluates their potential role in glioblastoma on the basis of
      preclinical studies and emerging clinical data. Furthermore, we discuss
      challenges that need to be considered in the clinical development of drugs that
      target immune checkpoint pathways in glioblastoma, such as specific properties of
      the immune system in the CNS, issues with radiological response assessment, and
      potential interactions with established and emerging treatment strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The hybrid approach for the initial management of hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome shifts the risks of major open surgery from the vulnerable
      neonatal period to an older age. This study determined differences between the
      hybrid and the standard Norwood procedures in postoperative in-hospital
      mortality, renal failure, and survival to at least 2 years of age. METHODS: Data 
      from the Pediatric Health Information System, a detailed hospital discharge
      database of 43 freestanding children's hospitals, were analyzed. The Pediatric
      Health Information System includes demographic information, diagnosis, and
      procedure and clinical service data. Instrumental variable regression techniques 
      were used to estimate the predicted probability of in-hospital mortality, renal
      failure, and survival to 24 months of age for infants with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome who received a hybrid or Norwood procedure. The statistical models
      controlled for demographics and comorbid chromosomal anomalies. RESULTS: A total 
      of 3654 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent intervention from 
      1998 to 2012. Of these, 242 underwent the hybrid approach and the remainder
      underwent the Norwood procedure. Instrumental variable models showed
      significantly reduced odds of patients who underwent the hybrid approach being
      diagnosed with renal failure (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 0.48; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.26-0.89); increased odds of surviving initial hospitalization
      (ARR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.55); increased odds of survival, indicated by
      readmissions more than 6 months after initial hospitalization (ARR, 1.53; 95% CI,
      1.05-2.22); and a decrease in length of stay by 20 days for the initial surgical 
      hospitalization (95% CI, -27.4 to -13.9). CONCLUSIONS: The short term
      hospital-based outcomes and longer-term survival outcomes of the hybrid approach 
      for hypoplastic left heart syndrome may be better than those of the Norwood
      procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Safe and effective treatments are urgently needed for patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the efficacy and 
      safety of vosaroxin, a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative, plus
      cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia.
      METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken at
      101 international sites. Eligible patients with acute myeloid leukaemia were aged
      18 years of age or older and had refractory disease or were in first relapse
      after one or two cycles of previous induction chemotherapy, including at least
      one cycle of anthracycline (or anthracenedione) plus cytarabine. Patients were
      randomly assigned 1:1 to vosaroxin (90 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 4 in a
      first cycle; 70 mg/m(2) in subsequent cycles) plus cytarabine (1 g/m(2)
      intravenously on days 1-5) or placebo plus cytarabine through a central
      interactive voice system with a permuted block procedure stratified by disease
      status, age, and geographical location. All participants were masked to treatment
      assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival and the primary
      safety endpoint was 30-day and 60-day all-cause mortality. Efficacy analyses were
      done by intention to treat; safety analyses included all treated patients. This
      study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01191801. FINDINGS:
      Between Dec 17, 2010, and Sept 25, 2013, 711 patients were randomly assigned to
      vosaroxin plus cytarabine (n=356) or placebo plus cytarabine (n=355). At the
      final analysis, median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% CI 6.4-8.5) in the
      vosaroxin plus cytarabine group and 6.1 months (5.2-7.1) in the placebo plus
      cytarabine group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.73-1.02; unstratified log-rank
      p=0.061; stratified p=0.024). A higher proportion of patients achieved complete
      remission in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group than in the placebo plus
      cytarabine group (107 [30%] of 356 patients vs 58 [16%] of 355 patients,
      p<0.0001). Early mortality was similar between treatment groups (30-day: 28 [8%] 
      of 355 patients in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group vs 23 [7%] of 350 in the
      placebo plus cytarabine group; 60-day: 70 [20%] vs 68 [19%]). Treatment-related
      deaths occurred at any time in 20 (6%) of 355 patients given vosaroxin plus
      cytarabine and in eight (2%) of 350 patients given placebo plus cytarabine.
      Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 116 (33%) and 58 (17%)
      patients in each group, respectively. Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were
      more frequent in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group than in the placebo plus
      cytarabine group included febrile neutropenia (167 [47%] vs 117 [33%]),
      neutropenia (66 [19%] vs 49 [14%]), stomatitis (54 [15%] vs 10 [3%]),
      hypokalaemia (52 [15%] vs 21 [6%]), bacteraemia (43 [12%] vs 16 [5%]), sepsis (42
      [12%] vs 18 [5%]), and pneumonia (39 [11%] vs 26 [7%]). INTERPRETATION: Although 
      there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between groups, the
      prespecified secondary analysis stratified by randomisation factors suggests that
      the addition of vosaroxin to cytarabine might be of clinical benefit to some
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. FUNDING: Sunesis

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in 
      adults. The existence of a small population of stem-like tumor cells that
      efficiently propagate tumors and resist cytotoxic therapy is one proposed
      mechanism leading to the resilient behavior of tumor cells and poor prognosis. In
      this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the DNA methylation landscape in
      GBM-derived cancer stem cells (GSCs). Parallel comparisons of primary tumors and 
      GSC lines derived from these tumors with normal controls (a neural stem cell
      (NSC) line and normal brain tissue) identified groups of hyper- and
      hypomethylated genes that display a trend of either increasing or decreasing
      methylation levels in the order of controls, primary GBMs, and their counterpart 
      GSC lines, respectively. Interestingly, concurrent promoter hypermethylation and 
      gene body hypomethylation were observed in a subset of genes including MGMT,
      AJAP1 and PTPRN2. These unique DNA methylation signatures were also found in
      primary GBM-derived xenograft tumors indicating that they are not tissue
      culture-related epigenetic changes. Integration of GSC-specific epigenetic
      signatures with gene expression analysis further identified candidate tumor
      suppressor genes that are frequently down-regulated in GBMs such as SPINT2, NEFM 
      and PENK. Forced re-expression of SPINT2 reduced glioma cell proliferative
      capacity, anchorage independent growth, cell motility, and tumor sphere formation
      in vitro. The results from this study demonstrate that GSCs possess unique
      epigenetic signatures that may play important roles in the pathogenesis of GBM.

TI  - Eltrombopag for children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (PETIT2): a
      randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag has been shown to be 
      safe, tolerable, and effective for adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia.
      We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag for children with 
      chronic immune thrombocytopenia. METHODS: PETIT2 was a two part, randomised,
      multicentre, placebo-controlled study done at 38 centres in 12 countries
      (Argentina, Czech Republic, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain,
      Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA). Paediatric patients aged 1-17 years who had
      chronic immune thrombocytopenia and platelet counts less than 30 x 10(9) per L
      were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive eltrombopag or placebo. We stratified
      patients by age into three cohorts (patients aged 12-17 years, 6-11 years, and
      1-5 years) before randomly entering them into a 13 week, double-blind period.
      Randomisation was done by the GlaxoSmithKline Registration and Medication
      Ordering System and both patients and study personnel were masked to treatment
      assignments. Patients who were allocated eltrombopag received tablets (except for
      those aged 1-5 years who received an oral suspension formulation) once per day
      for 13 weeks. Starting doses for patients aged 6-17 were based on bodyweight, and
      ethnic origin and ranged between 50 mg/day and 25 mg/day (starting dose for
      patients aged 1-5 years was 1.2 mg/kg/day or 0.8 mg/kg/day for east Asian
      patients). Patients who completed the double-blind period entered a 24 week
      open-label treatment period in which all patients received eltrombopag at either 
      the starting dose (if they were formerly on placebo) or their established dose.
      The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving platelet counts of
      at least 50 x 10(9) per L in the absence of rescue therapy for 6 or more weeks
      from weeks 5 to 12 of the double-blind period. The intention-to-treat population 
      included in the efficacy assessment consisted of all patients who were randomly
      assigned to one of the treatment groups, and the safety population included all
      patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered
      with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01520909. FINDINGS: Beginning in March 15,
      2012, 92 patients were enrolled, and the trial was completed on Jan 2, 2014. 63
      patients were assigned to receive eltrombopag and 29 were assigned to receive
      placebo. In the double-blind period, three patients discontinued treatment
      because of adverse events: two patients in the eltrombopag group withdrew because
      of increased liver aminotransferases and one in the placebo group withdrew
      because of abdominal haemorrhage. 25 (40%) patients who received eltrombopag
      compared with one (3%) patient who received placebo achieved the primary outcome 
      of platelet counts of at least 50 x 10(9) per L for 6 of the last 8 weeks of the 
      double-blind period (odds ratio 18.0, 95% CI, 2.3-140.9; p=0.0004). Responses
      were similar in all cohorts (eltrombopag vs placebo: 39% vs 10% for patients aged
      12-17 years, 42% vs 0% for patients aged 6-11 years, and 36% vs 0% for patients
      aged 1-5 years). Proportionately fewer patients who received eltrombopag (23
      [37%] of 63 patients) had WHO grades 1-4 bleeding at the end of the double-blind 
      period than did those who received placebo (16 [55%] of 29 patients); grades 2-4 
      bleeding were similar (three [5%] patients who received eltrombopag vs two [7%]
      patients who received placebo). During the 24-week open-label treatment period,
      70 [80%] of 87 patients achieved platelet counts of 50 x 10(9) per L or more at
      least once. Adverse events that occurred more frequently with eltrombopag than
      with placebo included nasopharyngitis (11 [17%] patients), rhinitis (10 [16%]
      patients), upper respiratory tract infection (7 [11%] patients), and cough (7
      [11%] patients). Serious adverse events occurred in five (8%) patients who
      received eltrombopag and four (14%) who received placebo. Safety was consistent
      between the open-label and double-blind periods. No deaths, malignancies, or
      thromboses occurred during the trial. INTERPRETATION: Eltrombopag, which produced
      a sustained platelet response in 40% of patients with chronic immune
      thrombocytopenia, is a suitable therapeutic option for children with chronic
      symptomatic immune thrombocytopenia. We identified no new safety concerns and few
      patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. FUNDING:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) 
      have produced varying results. STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind placebo-controlled
      randomized controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 52 children, adolescents,
      and adults with biopsy-proven IgAN in 30 centers in the United States and Canada.
      Entry criteria: age older than 7 to younger than 70 years; urine
      protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), >/=0.6g/g (males) or >/=0.8g/g (females); and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate >/= 50mL/min/1.73m(2) (>/=40mL/min/1.73m(2) 
      if receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). Mean age, 32+/-12 (SD)
      years; 62% men; and 73% white. INTERVENTION: Lisinopril (or losartan) plus a
      highly purified omega-3 fatty acid (Omacor [Pronova Biocare]) was given to 94
      patients for 3 months; 52 of the patients with persistent UPCR>/=0.6g/g (males)
      and >/=0.8g/g (females) were randomly assigned to MMF or placebo (target dose,
      25-36mg/kg/d) in addition to lisinopril/losartan plus Omacor. OUTCOMES: Change in
      UPCR after 6 and 12 months treatment with MMF/placebo and 12 months after the end
      of treatment. MEASUREMENTS: UPCR measured on 24-hour urine samples. Glomerular
      filtration rate estimated with the Schwartz (age < 18 years) or Cockcroft-Gault
      (age >/= 18 years) formula. RESULTS: 44 patients completed 6 months of treatment 
      with MMF (n=22) or placebo (n=22). The trial was terminated early at the
      recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee because of the lack of benefit.
      No patient achieved a complete remission (UPCR<0.2g/g). Mean UPCRs at
      randomization and after 6 months were 1.45 (95% CI, 1.16-1.75) and 1.40 (95% CI, 
      1.09-1.70) for MMF and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17-1.65) and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.13-2.04) for 
      placebo, respectively. The mean difference in UPCR change between these groups
      (MMF minus placebo) was -0.22 (95% CI, -0.75 to 0.31; P=0.4). Adverse events were
      rare apart from nausea (MMF, 8.7%; placebo, 3.7%); one of these MMF patients
      withdrew. LIMITATIONS: Low patient enrollment and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
      MMF did not reduce proteinuria significantly in patients with IgAN who had
      persistent proteinuria after lisinopril/losartan plus Omacor.

AB  - Autophagy is a complex pathway regulated by numerous signalling events that
      recycles macromolecules and may be perturbed in lysosomal storage disorders
      (LSDs). During autophagy, aberrant regulation of the lysosomal Ca(2+) efflux
      channel TRPML1 [transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1)], also known as
      MCOLN1, is solely responsible for the human LSD mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV);
      however, the exact mechanisms involved in the development of the pathology of
      this LSD are unknown. In the present study, we provide evidence that the target
      of rapamycin (TOR), a nutrient-sensitive protein kinase that negatively regulates
      autophagy, directly targets and inactivates the TRPML1 channel and thereby
      functional autophagy, through phosphorylation. Further, mutating these
      phosphorylation sites to unphosphorylatable residues proved to block TOR
      regulation of the TRPML1 channel. These findings suggest a mechanism for how TOR 
      activity may regulate the TRPML1 channel.

TI  - Genomic predictors of patterns of progression in glioblastoma and possible
      influences on radiation field design.
PG  - 447-53
LID - 10.1007/s11060-015-1858-2 [doi]
AB  - We present a retrospective investigation of the role of genomics in the
      prediction of central versus marginal disease progression patterns for
      glioblastoma (GBM). Between August 2000 and May 2010, 41 patients with GBM and
      gene expression and methylation data available were treated with radiotherapy
      with or without concurrent temozolomide. Location of disease progression was
      categorized as within the high dose (60 Gy) or low dose (46 Gy) volume. Samples
      were grouped into previously described TCGA genomic groupings: Mesenchymal (m),
      classical (c), proneural (pn), and neural (n); and were also classified by
      MGMT-Methylation status and G-Cimp methylation phenotype. Genomic groupings and
      methylation status were investigated as a possible predictor of disease
      progression in the high dose region, progression in the low dose region, and time
      to progression. Based on TCGA category there was no difference in OS (p = 0.26), 
      60 Gy progression (PN: 71 %, N: 60 %, M: 89 %, C: 83 %, p = 0.19), 46 Gy
      progression (PN: 57 %, N: 40 %, M: 61 %,C: 50 %, p = 0.8) or time to progression 
      (PN: 9 months, N:15 months, M: 9 months, C: 7 months, p = 0.58). MGMT methylation
      predicted for improved OS (median 25 vs. 13 months, p = 0.01), improved DFS
      (median 13 vs. 8 months, p = 0.007) and decreased 60 Gy (p = 0.003) and 46 Gy (p 
      = 0.006) progression. There was a cohort of MGMT methylated patients with late
      marginal disease progression (4/22 patients, 18 %). TCGA groups demonstrated no
      difference in survival or progression patterns. MGMT methylation predicted for a 
      statistically significant decrease in in-field and marginal disease progression. 
      There was a cohort of MGMT methylated patients with late marginal progression.
      Validations of these findings would have implications that could affect radiation
      field size.

TI  - Exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF generates TDP-43 aggregates in glioblastoma cells through
      exosomes and TNTs-like structure.
PG  - 24178-91
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent a
      continuum of devastating neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by transactive
      response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) aggregates accumulation
      throughout the nervous system. Despite rapidly emerging evidence suggesting the
      hypothesis of 'prion-like propagation' of TDP-43 positive inclusion in the
      regional spread of ALS symptoms, whether and how TDP-43 aggregates spread between
      cells is not clear. Herein, we established a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-cultured
      cell model to dissect mechanisms governing TDP-43 aggregates formation and
      propagation. Remarkably, intracellular TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregates were
      induced in the human glioma U251 cells following exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF but not 
      ALS-CSF and normal control (NC) -CSF for 21 days. The exosomes derived from
      ALS-FTD-CSF were enriched in TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Incubation of
      ALS-FTD-CSF induced the increase of mislocated TDP-43 positive exosomes in U251
      cells. We further demonstrated that exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF induced the
      generations of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-like structure and exosomes at
      different stages, which mediated the propagation of TDP-43 aggregates in the
      cultured U251 cells. Moreover, immunoblotting analyses revealed that abnormal
      activations of apoptosis and autophagy were induced in U251 cells, following
      incubation of ALS-CSF and ALS-FTD-CSF. Taken together, our data provide direct
      evidence that ALS-FTD-CSF has prion-like transmissible properties. TNTs-like
      structure and exosomes supply the routes for the transfer of TDP-43 aggregates,
      and selective inhibition of their over-generations may interrupt the progression 
      of TDP-43 proteinopathy.

TI  - Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of acute exacerbations of
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a retrospective study.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s12890-015-0066-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been recognized that despite previous stability some patients 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) experience acute clinical deteriorations
      called acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AEX-IPF). We
      hypothesized that pulmonary infection can be excluded based on clinical and
      laboratory data and that bronchoscopy with BAL is not mandatory in the diagnostic
      work-up of suspected AEX-IPF. METHODS: In this retrospective study we identified 
      patients with acute respiratory failure who were evaluated for AEX-IPF at the
      Cleveland Clinic between January 2002 and December 2011. Univariate and
      multivariate analysis were performed with predefined risk factors and final
      diagnosis of AEX-IPF and pulmonary infection. All tests were performed at a
      significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients met the study
      inclusion criteria. Of these patients 47 (61 %) were diagnosed with AEX-IPF.
      Bronchoscopy was more likely to be performed in patients who were on cytotoxic
      medications (p < 0.05). In most cases the diagnosis of AEX-IPF versus pulmonary
      infection was based on combination of other microbiological, clinical, radiologic
      data and clinical judgment. A total of 10 patients out of 14 (71 %) with a final 
      diagnosis of pulmonary infection were on steroids on admission versus 21 out of
      63 patients (33 %) with other final diagnosis (p = 0.024, OR 7.817, 95 % CI
      1.31-46.64). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusion of infection in our IPF patient cohort was
      mostly based on factors other than diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL. Based on our
      results we suggested an algorithm for management of IPF patients presenting with 
      acute respiratory failure.

TI  - Exosomes isolated from plasma of glioma patients enrolled in a vaccination trial 
      reflect antitumor immune activity and might predict survival.
PG  - e1008347
AB  - Exosomes in plasma of glioma patients hold promise as biomarkers of prognosis. We
      aimed to determine whether changes in total exosomal protein and mRNA expression 
      levels could serve as surrogate markers of immunological and clinical responses
      in glioma patients receiving antitumor vaccines. Exosomes were isolated from
      pre/post-vaccine plasma specimens in 20/22 patients enrolled in a phase I/II
      trial with the antitumor vaccine. Exosomal protein content was analyzed and mRNA 
      expression levels for 24 genes were simultaneously assessed by qRT-PCR. Pre- to
      post-vaccination changes in exosomal protein and DeltaCt values were correlated
      with immunological and clinical responses and survival using Spearman rank
      statistics and hazard ratios (HR). Exosomal protein levels positively correlated 
      (p < 0.0043) with the WHO tumor grade at diagnosis. Protein levels were lower in 
      post- vs. pre-vaccination exosome fractions. Post-therapy increases in tumor size
      were associated with elevations in exosome proteins in glioblastoma but not
      always in anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Only exosomal DeltaCt values for IL-8,
      TIMP-1, TGF-beta and ZAP70 were significant (p < 0.04 to p < 0.001). The DeltaCt 
      for IL-8 and TGF-beta mRNA positively correlated with post-vaccine immunologic
      responses to glioma antigens, while DeltaCt for TIMP-1 mRNA was negatively
      correlated to DeltaCt for IL-8 and TGF-beta. Only DeltaCt for IL-8 weakly
      correlated with OS and time to progression (TTP). In post-vaccine exosomes of the
      longest surviving patient with AA, mRNA for PD-1 was persistently elevated.
      Protein and mRNA expression levels for immune-related genes in plasma exosomes
      were useful in evaluating glioma patients' response to vaccination therapy.

AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a rare entity in the pediatric population. 
      Children with mycotic (infectious) AAA in particular are at risk of
      life-threatening rupture due to their rapid expansion coupled with aortic wall
      thinning and deterioration. Here, we present the case of a 10-month-old infant
      with prior 2-staged repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome that was
      incidentally discovered to have a mycotic AAA on abdominal ultrasound (US) for
      evaluation of renovascular hypertension. Before the time of evaluation with US,
      the infant had developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 3
      days after cardiac catheterization with percutaneous thoracic aortic balloon
      angioplasty. She had normal aortic contours on contrasted computed tomography
      scan of the abdomen approximately 2 weeks before the aforementioned US
      evaluation. This infant subsequently underwent open aneurysmorrhaphy with
      cryopreserved vein patch angioplasty with resolution of her aneurysmal segment.

TI  - The Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Clinical Research Network (IPFnet): diagnostic 
      and adjudication processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored IPF Clinical 
      Research Network (IPFnet) studies enrolled subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF) to evaluate drug therapies in treatment trials. An adjudication
      committee (AC) provided a structured review of cases in which there was
      uncertainty or disagreement regarding diagnosis or clinical event classification.
      This article describes the diagnosis and adjudication processes. METHODS: The
      diagnostic process was based on review of clinical data and high-resolution CT
      scans with central review of lung biopsies when available. The AC worked closely 
      with the data coordinating center to obtain clinical, radiologic, and histologic 
      data and to communicate with the clinical centers. The AC used a
      multidisciplinary discussion model with four clinicians, one radiologist, and one
      pathologist to adjudicate diagnosis and outcome measures. RESULTS: The IPFnet
      trials screened 1,015 subjects; of these, 23 cases required review by the AC to
      establish eligibility. The most common diagnosis for exclusion was suspected
      chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The AC reviewed 88 suspected acute
      exacerbations (AExs), 93 nonelective hospitalizations, and 16 cases of bleeding. 
      Determination of AEx presented practical challenges to adjudicators, as necessary
      clinical data were often not collected, particularly when subjects were evaluated
      outside of the primary study site. CONCLUSIONS: The IPFnet diagnostic process was
      generally efficient, but a multidisciplinary adjudication committee was critical 
      to assure correct phenotype for study enrollment. The AC was key in adjudicating 
      all adverse outcomes in two IPFnet studies terminated early because of safety
      issues. Future clinical trials in IPF should consider logistical and cost issues 
      as they incorporate AExs and hospitalizations as outcome measures. TRIAL

TI  - The gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor TGLI1 enhances expression of
      VEGF-C and TEM7 to promote glioblastoma angiogenesis.
PG  - 22653-65
AB  - We recently discovered that truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1
      (TGLI1) is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and linked to increased GBM
      vascularity. The mechanisms underlying TGLI1-mediated angiogenesis are unclear.
      In this study, we compared TGLI1- with GLI1-expressing GBM xenografts for the
      expression profile of 84 angiogenesis-associated genes. The results showed that
      expression of six genes were upregulated and five were down-regulated in
      TGLI1-carrying tumors compared to those with GLI1. Vascular endothelial growth
      factor-C (VEGF-C) and tumor endothelial marker 7 (TEM7) were selected for further
      investigations because of their significant correlations with high vascularity in
      135 patient GBMs. TGLI1 bound to both VEGF-C and TEM7 gene promoters. Conditioned
      medium from TGLI1-expressing GBM cells strongly induced tubule formation of brain
      microvascular endothelial cells, and the induction was prevented by VEGF-C/TEM7
      knockdown. Immunohistochemical analysis of 122 gliomas showed that TGLI1
      expression was positively correlated with VEGF-C, TEM7 and microvessel density.
      Analysis of NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus datasets with 161 malignant gliomas
      showed an inverse relationship between tumoral VEGF-C, TEM7 or microvessel
      density and patient survival. Together, our findings support an important role
      that TGLI1 plays in GBM angiogenesis and identify VEGF-C and TEM7 as novel TGLI1 
      target genes of importance to GBM vascularity.

TI  - A modular approach to intensity-modulated arc therapy optimization with
      noncoplanar trajectories.

AB  - Utilizing noncoplanar beam angles in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has 
      the potential to combine the benefits of arc therapy, such as short treatment
      times, with the benefits of noncoplanar intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
      plans, such as improved organ sparing. Recently, vendors introduced treatment
      machines that allow for simultaneous couch and gantry motion during beam delivery
      to make noncoplanar VMAT treatments possible. Our aim is to provide a reliable
      optimization method for noncoplanar isocentric arc therapy plan optimization. The
      proposed solution is modular in the sense that it can incorporate different
      existing beam angle selection and coplanar arc therapy optimization methods.
      Treatment planning is performed in three steps. First, a number of promising
      noncoplanar beam directions are selected using an iterative beam selection
      heuristic; these beams serve as anchor points of the arc therapy trajectory. In
      the second step, continuous gantry/couch angle trajectories are optimized using a
      simple combinatorial optimization model to define a beam trajectory that
      efficiently visits each of the anchor points. Treatment time is controlled by
      limiting the time the beam needs to trace the prescribed trajectory. In the third
      and final step, an optimal arc therapy plan is found along the prescribed beam
      trajectory. In principle any existing arc therapy optimization method could be
      incorporated into this step; for this work we use a sliding window VMAT
      algorithm. The approach is demonstrated using two particularly challenging cases.
      The first one is a lung SBRT patient whose planning goals could not be satisfied 
      with fewer than nine noncoplanar IMRT fields when the patient was treated in the 
      clinic. The second one is a brain tumor patient, where the target volume overlaps
      with the optic nerves and the chiasm and it is directly adjacent to the
      brainstem. Both cases illustrate that the large number of angles utilized by
      isocentric noncoplanar VMAT plans can help improve dose conformity, homogeneity, 
      and organ sparing simultaneously using the same beam trajectory length and
      delivery time as a coplanar VMAT plan.

AB  - An oncolytic virus (OV) based on poliovirus (PV), the highly attenuated
      polio/rhinovirus recombinant PVSRIPO, may deliver targeted inflammatory cancer
      cell killing; a principle that is showing promise in clinical trials for
      recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The two decisive factors in PVSRIPO anti-tumor
      efficacy are selective cytotoxicity and its in situ immunogenic imprint. While
      our work is focused on what constitutes PVSRIPO cancer cytotoxicity, we are also 
      studying how this engenders host immune responses that are vital to tumor
      regression. We hypothesize that PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are
      inextricably linked in essential, complimentary roles that define the
      anti-neoplastic response. Herein we delineate mechanisms we unraveled to decipher
      the basis for PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and its immunotherapeutic potential.

TI  - Orthogonal targeting of EGFRvIII expressing glioblastomas through simultaneous
      EGFR and PLK1 inhibition.
PG  - 11751-67
AB  - We identified a synthetic lethality between PLK1 silencing and the expression of 
      an oncogenic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFRvIII. PLK1 promoted homologous
      recombination (HR), mitigating EGFRvIII induced oncogenic stress resulting from
      DNA damage accumulation. Accordingly, PLK1 inhibition enhanced the cytotoxic
      effects of the DNA damaging agent, temozolomide (TMZ). This effect was
      significantly more pronounced in an Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII glioblastoma model
      relative to an Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-beta model. The tumoricidal and
      TMZ-sensitizing effects of BI2536 were uniformly observed across Ink4a/Arf(-/-)
      EGFRvIII glioblastoma clones that acquired independent resistance mechanisms to
      EGFR inhibitors, suggesting these resistant clones retain oncogenic stress that
      required PLK1 compensation. Although BI2536 significantly augmented the
      anti-neoplastic effect of EGFR inhibitors in the Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII model,
      durable response was not achieved until TMZ was added. Our results suggest that
      optimal therapeutic effect against glioblastomas requires a "multi-orthogonal"
      combination tailored to the molecular physiology associated with the target
      cancer genome.

TI  - Transient Increased Calcium and Calcitriol Requirements After Discontinuation of 
      Human Synthetic Parathyroid Hormone 1-34 (hPTH 1-34) Replacement Therapy in
      Hypoparathyroidism.
PG  - 2112-8
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.2555 [doi]
AB  - Synthetic human PTH 1-34 (hPTH 1-34) replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism
      maintains eucalcemia and converts quiescent bone to high-turnover bone. However, 
      the skeletal and metabolic effects of drug discontinuation have not been
      reported. Nine subjects with hypoparathyroidism received subcutaneous injections 
      of hPTH 1-34 two to three times daily for 19.8 to 61.3 months and then
      transitioned back to calcium and calcitriol. Biochemistries and bone mineral
      density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were assessed at
      baseline, while on treatment, and at follow-up 3 to 12 months after drug
      discontinuation. Two subjects developed hypocalcemia when hPTH 1-34 was abruptly 
      discontinued. Thus, to avoid hypocalcemia, subjects were slowly weaned from hPTH 
      1-34 over several weeks. When hPTH 1-34 was stopped, subjects were requiring two 
      to three times pretreatment doses of calcitriol and calcium to maintain blood
      calcium levels. Doses were gradually reduced over many weeks until calcium levels
      were stable on doses similar to baseline. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
      (BSAP), N-telopeptide (NTX), and osteocalcin (OC) increased significantly with
      hPTH 1-34; at follow-up, BSAP and NTX had returned to baseline while OC was still
      slightly elevated. During treatment, BMD was unchanged at the hip and lateral
      spine but declined at the anterior-posterior (AP) spine, radius, and total body. 
      During weaning, BMD increased, with the hip and lateral spine exceeding pre-hPTH 
      1-34 values and the whole body returning to baseline. AP spine was increased
      non-significantly compared to baseline at follow-up. hPTH 1-34 must be gradually 
      weaned in hypoparathyroid patients with high doses of oral medications given to
      avoid hypocalcemia. The transient increased requirements accompanied by increased
      BMD after long-term hPTH 1-34 therapy suggest a reversal of the expanded
      remodeling space favoring bone formation as the skeleton returns to a
      low-turnover state, reminiscent of the hungry bone syndrome. Further study and
      close monitoring is required to ensure safe transition to conventional therapy
      and to elucidate the physiological mechanism of this phenomenon.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is one of the most common causes of inherited
      hypokalaemia. As it was caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene, GS is a highly
      heterogeneous disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic
      characteristics of two Chinese pedigrees and summarize the advance in GS
      genetics, diagnosis and management. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two three-generation
      families with GS were identified and screened for mutations in the SLC12A3 gene. 
      Genotype-phenotype correlations were analysed. RESULTS: The two probands (A and
      B) were characterized by hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria without 
      hypertension. Complete DNA sequencing of the SLC12A3 gene revealed two novel
      compound heterozygous mutations (c.179C>T and c.234delG; c.486-490delTACGGinsA
      and c.1925G>A), which are predicted to drastically affect normal protein
      structure. The female members of the pedigrees showed mild-to-no phenotype,
      although they carried the same mutations as the probands. Moreover, proband B
      presented with more severe symptoms than did proband A, which might be related to
      a lower serum magnesium level. During the 1-year follow-up, both probands showed 
      satisfactory symptom improvement following the use of potassium and magnesium
      supplements. CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly suggested that the two novel
      mutations in the SLC12A3 gene are the causative agents of GS, which may provide
      further insights into the function of this gene and help clinicians better
      understand this disorder.

AB  - Chronic lung diseases are becoming a leading cause of death worldwide. There are 
      few effective treatments for those patients and less choices to prevent the
      exacerbation or even reverse the progress of the diseases. Over the past decade, 
      cell-based therapies using stem cells to regenerate lung tissue have experienced 
      a rapid growth in a variety of animal models for distinct lung diseases. This
      novel approach offers great promise for the treatment of several devastating and 
      incurable lung diseases, including emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
      pulmonary hypertension, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this
      review, we provide a concise summary of the current knowledge on the attributes
      of endogenous lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells (EpiSPCs), mesenchymal stem
      cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in both animal models and
      translational studies. We also describe the promise and challenges of tissue
      bioengineering in lung regenerative medicine. The therapeutic potential of MSCs
      is further discussed in IPF and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).

TI  - Consultative issues in surgical neuropathology: a retrospective review of the
      rationale for submitting cases for expert review.
PG  - 807-11
LID - 10.1309/AJCPWEP1HPX4EDCS [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Second opinions on neuropathology cases are sought for a variety of
      reasons. We investigated the rationales for seeking expert neuropathologic
      review. METHODS: A retrospective review was done of the correspondence
      accompanying neuropathology cases submitted over a 5-year period. The review used
      a taxonomy of referral reasons, the submitting diagnoses, and requests for
      ancillary tests. RESULTS: In total, 508 adult cases were submitted, including
      glioblastoma (n = 94), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 49), low-grade glioma (n =
      49), oligodendroglioma (n = 48), and pituitary adenoma (n = 12). Thirty-nine
      cases submitted requested ancillary testing. A taxonomy of four categories
      revealed the following: preliminary diagnosis (n = 228 cases) was the most common
      reason for requesting review, followed by no diagnosis rendered (n = 183 cases), 
      second opinion (n = 53), and confirmation/quality assurance (n = 43); the
      remaining case was "other." Overall, 456 cases were submitted by pathologists, 40
      by clinicians and 12 by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologists who predominately
      submit cases with a preliminary diagnosis rendered seek expert consultation while
      clinicians seek a second opinion.

TI  - Heparin enhances uptake of platelet factor 4/heparin complexes by monocytes and
      macrophages.
PG  - 1416-27
LID - 10.1111/jth.13003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an iatrogenic complication 
      of heparin therapy caused by antibodies to a self-antigen, platelet factor (4)
      and heparin. The reasons why antibodies form to PF4/heparin, but not to PF4 bound
      to other cellular glycosaminoglycans are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To
      investigate differences in cellular responses to cell-bound PF4 and PF4/heparin
      complexes, we studied the internalization of each by peripheral blood-derived
      monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using unlabeled 
      and fluorescently-labeled antigen and/or labeled monoclonal antibody to
      PF4/heparin complexes (KKO), we show that PF4/heparin complexes are taken up by
      monocytes in a heparin-dependent manner and are internalized by human monocytes
      and dendritic cells, but not by neutrophils. Complexes of
      PF4/low-molecular-weight heparin and complexes composed of heparin and murine
      PF4, protamine or lysozyme are internalized similarly, suggesting a common
      endocytic pathway. Uptake of complexes is mediated by macropinocytosis, as shown 
      by inhibition using cytochalasin D and amiloride. Internalized complexes are
      transported intact to late endosomes, as indicated by co-staining of vesicles
      with KKO and lysosomal associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2). Lastly, we show
      that cellular uptake is accompanied by expression of MHCII and CD83
      co-stimulatory molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these studies establish a 
      distinct role for heparin in enhancing antigen uptake and activation of the
      initial steps in the cellular immune response to PF4-containing complexes.

      difference of the 6-minute walk test in patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD) has been shown to be a valid
      and responsive outcome measure in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF). The analyses were based, however, on a single phase 3 trial and require
      validation in an independent cohort. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the performance
      characteristics and estimates of minimal clinically important difference (MCID)
      of 6MWD in an independent cohort of patients with IPF. METHODS: Patients
      randomized to placebo in the phase 3 CAPACITY trials who had a baseline 6MWD
      measurement were included in these analyses. The 6MWD and other functional
      parameters (lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life) were
      measured at baseline and 24-week intervals. Validity and responsiveness were
      examined using Spearman correlation coefficients. The MCID was estimated using
      distribution- and anchor-based methods. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 338
      patients. Baseline 6MWD was significantly correlated with lung function measures,
      patient-reported outcomes, and quality-of-life measures (validity). Compared with
      baseline 6MWD, change in 6MWD (responsiveness) showed stronger correlations with 
      change in lung function parameters and quality-of-life measures. Dyspnea measured
      by the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire
      showed the strongest correlations with 6MWD (baseline: coefficient -0.35; 48-week
      change: coefficient -0.37; both p < 0.001). The distribution-based analyses of
      MCID using standard error of measurement yielded an MCID of 37 m, and
      distribution-based analyses by effect size resulted in 29.2 m. The MCID by
      anchor-based analysis using criterion referencing (health events of
      hospitalization or death) was 21.7 m. CONCLUSIONS: The 6MWD is a valid and
      responsive clinical endpoint, which provides objective and clinically meaningful 
      information regarding functional status and near-term prognosis. These results
      confirm previous findings in an independent cohort of patients with IPF.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain neoplasm. Despite
      advances in treatment, GBM continues to be associated with considerable morbidity
      and mortality as compared with other malignancies. Standard treatment for GBM
      results in survival of 12.9 months (95% CI: 12.3-13.7 months) with a median
      progression-free survival of 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.4-8.2 months) in a modern GBM 
      cohort. These aggressive tumors recur and treatment for recurrent GBM continues
      to have very poor outcomes. Prior to the use of bevacizumab, monoclonal antibody 
      to VEGF, 6-month progression-free survival in clinical trials for recurrent GBM
      ranged from 9 to 15%. Trials utilizing bevacizumab and its subsequent US FDA
      approval have given more hope to recurrent GBM and this concise review discusses 
      bevacizumab in recurrent GBM. This review focuses on time-to-event outcomes
      (overall survival, progression-free survival and 6-month progression-free
      survival) in clinical trials utilizing bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent
      GBM. For this review, we have chosen to focus primarily on Phase II clinical
      trials that have been published and available in the literature (PubMed). While
      we focused primarily on time-to-event variables, toxicity and safety of
      bevacizumab is very important and this agent can be associated with serious
      life-threatening toxicities. We have included a general section of toxicities but
      for a more lengthy review please see the excellent study by Odia and colleagues.

TI  - A new era in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: considerations for future clinical
      trials.
PG  - 243-9
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00200614 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has seen substantial progress in understanding the pathobiology, 
      natural history, and clinical significance of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF), culminating in the establishment of two effective medical therapies. Now
      seems an important time to reconsider the design and conduct of future IPF
      clinical trials. Building on lessons learned over the past decade, we use this
      perspective to lay out four key considerations for moving forward effectively and
      efficiently with the next generation of clinical trials in IPF. These are:
      development of a coordinated IPF clinical trials network; establishment of
      expectations for early phase proof of concept studies; adaptation of late-phase
      efficacy trial designs to the emergence of approved therapies, and; agreement on 
      primary end-points for late phase clinical trials. Continued progress in the
      field of IPF will require creativity and collaboration on the part of all
      stakeholders. We believe that addressing these four considerations will encourage
      and enable investment in this new era of drug development in IPF, and will lead
      to more rapid development of effective therapies.

TI  - Association of hospital admission and forced vital capacity endpoints with
      survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: analysis of a pooled
      cohort from three clinical trials.
PG  - 388-96
LID - 10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00093-4 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality is an impractical primary endpoint for clinical trials in
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who have mild-to-moderate
      physiological impairment because event rates are low. Change in forced vital
      capacity (FVC) is widely accepted as a surrogate for mortality and is the most
      common primary endpoint in clinical trials for this disorder. Use of hospital
      admission as a predictor for mortality, independent of FVC decline, has not been 
      well defined. We aimed to ascertain the independent and combined association of
      hospital admission and at least a 10% decrease in FVC with all-cause mortality.
      METHODS: We did a pooled cohort study of 517 patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis from three IPFnet multicentre randomised controlled trials. We compared 
      the incidence of non-elective hospital admission and a 10% or greater reduction
      in FVC across strata of baseline physiological impairment. We used Cox
      proportional-hazards models to assess the risk of all-cause mortality associated 
      with these surrogate events, occurring up to a predefined landmark timepoint. The
      three studies are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00650091,
      NCT00517933, and NCT00957242. FINDINGS: Seven patients died before the landmark
      timepoint. Of the 510 patients remaining, 38 (7%) were admitted to hospital up to
      the predefined timepoint and 58 (11%) had a categorical decrease in FVC of at
      least 10%. Most patients admitted to hospital did not have a 10% or greater
      decrease in FVC (30 vs eight). Both surrogate events were associated with
      subsequent time to death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR] for admission 4.05,
      95% CI 1.36-12.11 vs HR for 10% or greater decline in FVC 4.68, 1.83-11.99). When
      causes of hospital admission were considered, only respiratory events were
      associated with mortality (5.97, 1.81-19.74). INTERPRETATION: Hospital admission 
      might be an appropriate component of a clinically meaningful composite endpoint
      that improves the feasibility of clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis. Further studies are needed to refine the most appropriate definition of
      hospital admission for future trials. FUNDING: US National Heart, Lung, and Blood

TI  - Anaplastic ganglioglioma: a report of three cases and review of the literature.
PG  - 171-7
LID - 10.1007/s11060-015-1781-6 [doi]
AB  - Gangliogliomas are rare tumors of the central nervous system that are thought to 
      arise from a glioneuronal precursor and consist of both neuronal and glial
      elements. Grade III, or anaplastic ganglioglioma (AGG), most commonly affects
      children and young adults, generally arises in a supratentorial location, is
      highly epileptogenic, and often results in diffuse local and distant failure
      within the craniospinal axis. Pathologically, these tumors are graded by the
      degree of malignancy in their glial portion and radiologic diagnosis is difficult
      due to the wide variation in its degree of solid and cystic components, contrast 
      uptake, and calcification patterns. This report presents three cases of AGG, with
      initial treatment including subtotal resection followed by conformal
      radiotherapy. In the case where the AGG developed in the setting of an existent
      low-grade astrocytoma, the patient received no chemotherapy. Both of the other de
      novo cases were managed with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide.
      Recurrence occurred at 6, 16, and 20 months following therapy. Two of the three
      patients experienced symptomatic decline at recurrence, but experienced Karnofsky
      performance status (KPS) improvement after salvage therapy, including the
      reduction of cranial neuropathy and balance. All patients had a significant
      reduction in presenting symptoms following salvage therapy. Patients died at 23, 
      20, and 22 months following initial surgical management, respectively. A review
      of anaplastic and malignant gangliogliomas is presented in the context of these
      three cases.

TI  - Telomere dysfunction causes alveolar stem cell failure.
PG  - 5099-104
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1504780112 [doi]
AB  - Telomere syndromes have their most common manifestation in lung disease that is
      recognized as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. In both conditions,
      there is loss of alveolar integrity, but the underlying mechanisms are not known.
      We tested the capacity of alveolar epithelial and stromal cells from mice with
      short telomeres to support alveolar organoid colony formation and found that type
      2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), the stem cell-containing population, were
      limiting. When telomere dysfunction was induced in adult AEC2s by conditional
      deletion of the shelterin component telomeric repeat-binding factor 2, cells
      survived but remained dormant and showed all the hallmarks of cellular
      senescence. Telomere dysfunction in AEC2s triggered an immune response, and this 
      was associated with AEC2-derived up-regulation of cytokine signaling pathways
      that are known to provoke inflammation in the lung. Mice uniformly died after
      challenge with bleomycin, underscoring an essential role for telomere function in
      AEC2s for alveolar repair. Our data show that alveoloar progenitor senescence is 
      sufficient to recapitulate the regenerative defects, inflammatory responses, and 
      susceptibility to injury that are characteristic of telomere-mediated lung
      disease. They suggest alveolar stem cell failure is a driver of telomere-mediated
      lung disease and that efforts to reverse it may be clinically beneficial.

TI  - Efficacy of intense pulsed light for the treatment of burn scar dyschromias: a
      pilot study to assess patient satisfaction, safety, and willingness to pay.
PG  - S204-8
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000447 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No treatment algorithms exist to reliably treat burn scar
      dyschromias. Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been used successfully to treat
      hyperpigmentation disorders, but has not been studied extensively in the
      treatment of burn scars. The purpose of this investigation was to assess clinical
      efficacy and patient satisfaction with IPL for the treatment of burn scar
      dyschromia. METHODS: Patients with burn scar dyschromias were treated using the
      Lume 1 platform (Lumenis) to target pigmented lesions, using fluences between 10 
      and 22 joules/cm and filters ranging from 560 to 650 nm. At the conclusion of the
      study, providers assessed changes in burn scar dyschromia, whereas patients were 
      queried regarding satisfaction and perceived efficacy, using a 1 to 5 Likert
      scale. The patients, who were not charged for the IPL treatment, were queried
      regarding willingness to pay. RESULTS: Twenty patients (mean age, 35.4 years;
      mean total body surface area, 27.6%; mean composite Fitzpatrick score, 3.9)
      underwent IPL treatment of burn scar dyschromias, an average of 3.2 years after
      injury. Mean fluence was 15.4 J/cm (range, 10-22 J/cm), and the most common
      filter used was 590 nm (range, 560-650 nm). Mean area treated was 90.7 cm, with a
      range of 4 to 448 cm. Complications included pain (4), hyperpigmentation (1), and
      blistering (2). Sixteen patients noted mild to moderate improvement, reporting a 
      4.5 for efficacy and a 4.4 for satisfaction. Regarding willingness to pay,
      patients would spend a mean of U.S. $7429 to completely remove their scars, but
      only a median of U.S. $350 to get the actual results that they received. Mean
      length of follow-up was 3.8 months, with a standard deviation of 2.2 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients perceived IPL as an efficacious modality in the treatment
      of burn scar dyschromia, with a high level of satisfaction, despite the potential
      for morbidity. However, we are reluctant to recommend IPL for routine treatment
      of burn scar dyschromias, given only minimal improvement observed, potential for 
      complications, and a willingness to pay that is lower than the cost of providing 
      care.

TI  - Use of Activated Factor VII in Patients with Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: A 10
      Years Institutional Experience.
PG  - 375-9
LID - 10.1007/s00408-015-9720-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening condition
      with an obscure etiology and pathogenesis. It is associated with many drugs and
      diseases including chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and
      autoimmune disorders. This retrospective study reports our experience with 23
      patients who had DAH and received intravenous recombinant activated Factor VIIa
      (rFVIIa). METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who
      received intravenous rFVIIa for DAH at a tertiary care university hospital
      between January 1, 2003 and May 31, 2013. We report demographics, etiology of
      DAH, frequency and total dose of intravenous rFVIIa, effect of rFVIIa on DAH, and
      morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 +/- 19 years. There were 13 men
      and 10 women. Nine patients had Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)
      vasculitis, two had systemic lupus erythematosus, three had Good pasture's
      syndrome, seven were post-bone marrow transplant, one had idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura, and one had cryoglobulinemia. Treatment in the ICU was 
      required for 22 patients of whom 18 were intubated and on mechanical ventilation;
      one patient was treated on general medical service. All patients received 35-120 
      mcg/kg rFVIIa every 2 h until hemostasis was achieved or treatment was judged to 
      be inadequate. In 22/23 patients, bleeding resolved with rFVIIa therapy. The mean
      dose to control bleeding was 5 +/- 3 mg. Eight patients died (36 %) of their
      underlying condition; six of them had received bone marrow transplant, while two 
      had ANCA vasculitis. Deaths were due to multiorgan failure, sepsis, and
      progressive underlying disease. No overt, clinically obvious adverse thrombotic
      events were observed with the use of rFVIIa. CONCLUSION: Activated Factor VII can
      achieve hemostasis in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive, deadliest, and most common brain
      malignancy in adults. Despite the advances made in surgical techniques,
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival for GBM patients has remained 
      at a mere 14 months. GBM poses several unique challenges to currently available
      treatments for the disease. For example, GBM cells have the propensity to
      aggressively infiltrate/invade into the normal brain tissues and along the
      vascular tracks, which prevents complete resection of all malignant cells and
      limits the effect of localized radiotherapy while sparing normal tissue. Although
      anti-angiogenic treatment exerts anti-edematic effect in GBM, unfortunately,
      tumors progress with acquired increased invasiveness. Therefore, it is an
      important task to gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic and post-treatment
      invasive phenotypes of GBM in hopes that the gained knowledge would lead to novel
      GBM treatments that are more effective and less toxic. This review will give an
      overview of some of the signaling pathways that have been shown to positively and
      negatively regulate GBM invasion, including, the PI3K/Akt, Wnt, sonic
      hedgehog-GLI1, and microRNAs. The review will also discuss several approaches to 
      cancer therapies potentially altering GBM invasiveness.

AB  - PURPOSE: A case of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 is described and relevant
      literature is reviewed to raise awareness about this rare syndrome, including the
      classification of each subtype and the differentiating clinical manifestations.
      CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old African-American female presented for a routine
      evaluation with hearing loss, dystopia canthorum (W index = 2.74), and almost
      complete gray hair. In addition, she presented with heterochromia irides,
      different fundus pigmentation between eyes. The patient did not have any upper
      limbs defect, cranial skeletal abnormalities, or intestinal disorders.
      CONCLUSION: Facial abnormalities and a white forelock are prominent features
      difficult to overlook during a routine ophthalmological examination. A careful
      medical history in patients with suspected Waardenburg syndrome is important to
      accurately classify this rare condition and to identify potential systemic
      implications associated to each subtype. The associated systemic complications
      can be addressed and managed through referral to the appropriate subspecialties.

AB  - Choosing Wisely(R) is a medical stewardship initiative led by the American Board 
      of Internal Medicine Foundation in collaboration with professional medical
      societies in the United States. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) released
      its first Choosing Wisely(R) list in 2013. Using the same evidence-based
      methodology as in 2013, ASH has identified 5 additional tests and treatments that
      should be questioned by clinicians and patients under specific, indicated
      circumstances. The ASH 2014 Choosing Wisely(R) recommendations include: (1) do
      not anticoagulate for more than 3 months in patients experiencing a first venous 
      thromboembolic event in the setting of major, transient risk factors for venous
      thromboembolism; (2) do not routinely transfuse for chronic anemia or
      uncomplicated pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease; (3) do not
      perform baseline or surveillance computed tomography scans in patients with
      asymptomatic, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (4) do not test or treat 
      for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia if the clinical pretest probability of
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is low; and (5) do not treat patients with
      immune thrombocytopenia unless they are bleeding or have very low platelet
      counts.

AB  - PURPOSE: The incidences of atopic conditions (allergies, asthma, or eczema) and
      glioma vary by ethnicity. Atopic conditions are inversely associated with
      gliomas. We conducted a pooled multisite study investigating the associations of 
      atopic conditions with glioma in different race/ethnicity groups. METHODS: Using 
      glioma cases and healthy controls, unconditional logistic regression was
      conducted to assess the associations of atopic conditions with glioma separately 
      in white, black, Asian, and Hispanic subpopulations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Glioblastoma multiforme
      cases were less likely than controls to report a history of atopic conditions in 
      whites (OR = 0.46, [95% CI, 0.38-0.54]) and Asians (OR = 0.27, [95% CI,
      0.10-0.73]). The same trend was seen when looking at glioma cases of all
      histologies. An inverse association was not seen in blacks for glioblastoma
      multiforme or all histologies combined. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association
      between glioma and atopic conditions may vary by ethnicity due to a difference in
      the biology of atopic conditions in different ethnicities but may be due to
      chance because of the limitations of small nonwhite sample sizes.

TI  - Diffusion MRI quality control and functional diffusion map results in ACRIN
      6677/RTOG 0625: a multicenter, randomized, phase II trial of bevacizumab and
      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma.
PG  - 1883-92
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.2891 [doi]
AB  - Functional diffusion mapping (fDM) is a cancer imaging technique that quantifies 
      voxelwise changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Previous studies have 
      shown value of fDMs in bevacizumab therapy for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme 
      (GBM). The aim of the present study was to implement explicit criteria for
      diffusion MRI quality control and independently evaluate fDM performance in a
      multicenter clinical trial (RTOG 0625/ACRIN 6677). A total of 123 patients were
      enrolled in the current multicenter trial and signed institutional review
      board-approved informed consent at their respective institutions. MRI was
      acquired prior to and 8 weeks following therapy. A 5-point QC scoring system was 
      used to evaluate DWI quality. fDM performance was evaluated according to the
      correlation of these metrics with PFS and OS at the first follow-up time-point.
      Results showed ADC variability of 7.3% in NAWM and 10.5% in CSF. A total of 68%
      of patients had usable DWI data and 47% of patients had high quality DWI data
      when also excluding patients that progressed before the first follow-up. fDM
      performance was improved by using only the highest quality DWI. High
      pre-treatment contrast enhancing tumor volume was associated with shorter PFS and
      OS. A high volume fraction of increasing ADC after therapy was associated with
      shorter PFS, while a high volume fraction of decreasing ADC was associated with
      shorter OS. In summary, DWI in multicenter trials are currently of limited value 
      due to image quality. Improvements in consistency of image quality in multicenter
      trials are necessary for further advancement of DWI biomarkers.

TI  - Adaptive mitochondrial reprogramming and resistance to PI3K therapy.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/dju502 [doi]
LID - dju502 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
      have been developed as molecular therapy for cancer, but their efficacy in the
      clinic is modest, hampered by resistance mechanisms. METHODS: We studied the
      effect of PI3K therapy in patient-derived tumor organotypic cultures (from five
      patient samples), three glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cell lines, and an intracranial 
      model of glioblastoma in immunocompromised mice (n = 4-5 mice per group).
      Mechanisms of therapy-induced tumor reprogramming were investigated in a global
      metabolomics screening, analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell death,
      and modulation of protein phosphorylation. A high-throughput drug screening was
      used to identify novel preclinical combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors,
      and combination synergy experiments were performed. All statistical methods were 
      two-sided. RESULTS: PI3K therapy induces global metabolic reprogramming in tumors
      and promotes the recruitment of an active pool of the Ser/Thr kinase, Akt2 to
      mitochondria. In turn, mitochondrial Akt2 phosphorylates Ser31 in cyclophilin D
      (CypD), a regulator of organelle functions. Akt2-phosphorylated CypD supports
      mitochondrial bioenergetics and opposes tumor cell death, conferring resistance
      to PI3K therapy. The combination of a small-molecule antagonist of CypD protein
      folding currently in preclinical development, Gamitrinib, plus PI3K inhibitors
      (PI3Ki) reverses this adaptive response, produces synergistic anticancer activity
      by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis, and extends animal survival in a GBM model
      (vehicle: median survival = 28.5 days; Gamitrinib+PI3Ki: median survival = 40
      days, P = .003), compared with single-agent treatment (PI3Ki: median survival =
      32 days, P = .02; Gamitrinib: median survival = 35 days, P = .008 by two-sided
      unpaired t test). CONCLUSIONS: Small-molecule PI3K antagonists promote drug
      resistance by repurposing mitochondrial functions in bioenergetics and cell
      survival. Novel combination therapies that target mitochondrial adaptation can
      dramatically improve on the efficacy of PI3K therapy in the clinic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hurler syndrome is characterized by progressive multisystem
      deterioration leading to early death in childhood. This prospective study
      evaluated the long-term outcomes of patients with Hurler syndrome who underwent
      umbilical cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors. STUDY DESIGN: Only
      patients with Hurler syndrome who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation 
      between December 1995 and March 2006 (n = 25) and who were followed for at least 
      5 years (n = 19) were included in the analysis. The patients were longitudinally 
      evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of specialists following a standardized
      protocol. RESULTS: Median age at transplantation was 15.9 months (range 2.1-35), 
      and patients were followed up until a median age of 10.1 years (range 7.2-14.9). 
      Overall survival was 80%. All successfully transplanted patients achieved full
      donor chimerism and normal enzyme levels, and all children continue to make gains
      in development. Gross motor function was the most affected area. Vision and
      hearing were compromised in a minority of the patients, with some requiring
      corneal transplant or hearing aids. Cardiopulmonary function improved. Some
      children required orthopedic surgery, but severe complications were prevented in 
      most patients. Although longitudinal growth was lower than that of unaffected
      children, it was considerably higher than expected from the natural course of the
      disease. Head circumference normalized. Hydrocephalus was not observed at longer 
      follow-up, and cerebral atrophy decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      descriptive study of children with Hurler syndrome, unrelated umbilical cord
      blood transplantation was associated with improved somatic disease and
      neurodevelopment.

TI  - Epidemiology of invasive fungal infections in lung transplant recipients on
      long-term azole antifungal prophylaxis.
PG  - 311-8
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12516 [doi]
AB  - Lung transplant recipients (LTR) at our institution receive prolonged and mostly 
      lifelong azole antifungal (AF) prophylaxis. The impact of this prophylactic
      strategy on the epidemiology and outcome of invasive fungal infections (IFI) is
      unknown. This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We reviewed the
      medical records of all adult LTR from January 2002 to December 2011. Overall,
      16.5% (15 of 91) of patients who underwent lung transplantation during this time 
      period developed IFI. Nineteen IFI episodes were identified (eight proven, 11
      probable), 89% (17 of 19) of which developed during AF prophylaxis. LTR with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were more likely to develop IFI (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 
      1.15-15.91; p = 0.03). A higher hazard of mortality was observed among those who 
      developed IFI, although this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio
      [HR]: 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.58-4.05]; p = 0.27). Aspergillus
      fumigatus was the most common cause of IFI (45%), with pulmonary parenchyma being
      the most common site of infection. None of our patients developed disseminated
      invasive aspergillosis, cryptococcal or endemic fungal infections. IFI continue
      to occur in LTR, and the eradication of IFI appears to be challenging even with
      prolonged prophylaxis. Azole resistance is uncommon despite prolonged AF
      exposure.

TI  - Parental Communication and Experiences and Knowledge of Adolescent Siblings of
      Children with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.
PG  - 752-9
LID - 10.1007/s10897-014-9806-4 [doi]
AB  - 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the most common microdeletion in humans.
      There have been few studies assessing the impact of this condition on the family 
      and no previous studies conducted on unaffected siblings of children with
      22q11DS. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency, method, and
      content of information being communicated by parents to unaffected siblings about
      the condition and to assess unaffected siblings' knowledge of 22q11DS and
      perceptions of the impact of the condition on their affected sibling and
      themselves. Families were recruited from several 22q11DS educational and support 
      organizations and asked to complete a single anonymous online survey. Families
      were eligible to participate if they had one child with 22q11DS and at least one 
      unaffected child between the ages of 12 and 17. Survey questions were developed
      based on previous literature and authors' expertise with individuals with
      22q11DS. Responses to quantitative and qualitative questions were analyzed to
      calculate frequencies and proportions and to extract themes, respectively. A
      total of 25 families (defined as a unit of at least one parent, one affected
      child, and at least one unaffected child) participated in the study. Parents
      shared genetic information less often as compared to behavioral and medical
      information. Siblings of children with 22q11DS had both positive and negative
      experiences in having a brother or sister with this condition. Genetic counselors
      can use the results of this study to develop anticipatory guidance for parents of
      children with 22q11DS in talking with their unaffected children about the
      condition.

AB  - In utero interventions aimed at restoring left ventricular hemodynamic forces in 
      fetuses with prenatally diagnosed hypoplastic left heart syndrome failed to
      stimulate ventricular myocardial growth during gestation, suggesting chamber
      growth during development may not rely upon fluid forces. We therefore
      hypothesized that ventricular hypertrophy during development may depend upon
      fundamental Ca(2+)-dependent growth pathways that function independent of
      hemodynamic forces. To test this hypothesis, zebrafish embryos were treated with 
      inhibitors or activators of Ca(2+) signaling in the presence or absence of
      contraction during the period of chamber development. Abolishment of contractile 
      function alone in the setting of preserved Ca(2+) signaling did not impair
      ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, inhibition of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)
      influx abolished contraction and led to reduced ventricular hypertrophy, whereas 
      increasing L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx led to enhanced ventricular
      hypertrophy in either the presence or absence of contraction. Similarly,
      inhibition of the downstream Ca(2+)-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin, a known
      regulator of adult cardiac hypertrophy, led to reduced ventricular hypertrophy in
      the presence or absence of contraction, whereas hypertrophy was rescued in the
      absence of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx and contraction by expression of a 
      constitutively active calcineurin. These data suggest that ventricular
      cardiomyocyte hypertrophy during chamber formation is dependent upon Ca(2+)
      signaling pathways that are unaffected by heart function or hemodynamic forces.
      Disruption of Ca(2+)-dependent hypertrophy during heart development may therefore
      represent one mechanism for impaired chamber formation that is not related to
      impaired blood flow.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an extremely malignant brain tumor for which
      current therapies do little to remedy. Despite aggressive treatment with surgery,
      radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, tumors inevitably recur as a direct
      consequence of the infiltrative nature of GBM. The poor prognosis of patients
      with GBM underscores the clear and urgent need for more precise and potent
      therapies. Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising means to treat GBM based on
      the immune system's capacity to mediate tumor-specific cytotoxicity. In this
      review, we will discuss the use of peptide vaccines for the treatment of GBM. The
      simplicity of peptide vaccines and their ability to elicit tumor antigen-specific
      immune responses make them an invaluable tool for the study of brain tumor
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Choosing Wisely((R)) is a medical stewardship initiative led by the American
      Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in collaboration with professional medical 
      societies in the United States. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) released
      its first Choosing Wisely((R)) list in 2013. Using the same evidence-based
      methodology as in 2013, ASH has identified 5 additional tests and treatments that
      should be questioned by clinicians and patients under specific, indicated
      circumstances. The ASH 2014 Choosing Wisely((R)) recommendations include: (1) do 
      not anticoagulate for more than 3 months in patients experiencing a first venous 
      thromboembolic event in the setting of major, transient risk factors for venous
      thromboembolism; (2) do not routinely transfuse for chronic anemia or
      uncomplicated pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease; (3) do not
      perform baseline or surveillance computed tomography scans in patients with
      asymptomatic, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (4) do not test or treat 
      for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia if the clinical pretest probability of
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is low; and (5) do not treat patients with
      immune thrombocytopenia unless they are bleeding or have very low platelet
      counts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer generally have a
      progression-free survival of 9-13 months while being treated with the EGFR
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. However, resistance inevitably
      develops, and more effective EGFR inhibitors are needed. Dacomitinib is a
      covalent pan-HER inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients
      previously treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. We did a trial of dacomitinib as 
      initial systemic therapy in clinically and molecularly selected patients with
      advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: In this open-label, multicentre,
      phase 2 trial, we enrolled treatment-naive patients with advanced lung cancer who
      had clinical (never-smokers [<100 cigarettes per lifetime] or former light
      smokers [<10 pack-years per lifetime] and >/=15 years since last cigarette) or
      molecular (EGFR mutation, regardless of smoking status) characteristics
      associated with response to EGFR inhibitors. We gave dacomitinib orally once
      daily (45 mg or 30 mg) until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or
      patient withdrawal. We used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria
      (version 1.0) to investigate the activity of dacomitinib in all patients with a
      baseline scan and at least one post-treatment scan, with investigator assessment 
      of response and progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival
      at 4 months in the as-enrolled population, with a null hypothesis of
      progression-free survival at 4 months of 50% or less. The study is registered
      with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00818441, and is no longer accruing patients. 
      FINDINGS: Between March 11, 2009, and April 1, 2011, we enrolled 89 patients from
      25 centres, including 45 (51%) with EGFR-activating mutations in exon 19 (n=25)
      or exon 21 (n=20). Progression-free survival at 4 months was 76.8% (95% CI
      66.4-84.4) in the as-enrolled population, and was 95.5% (95% CI 83.2-98.9) in the
      EGFR-mutant population. The most common all-grade treatment-related adverse
      events were diarrhoea in 83 (93%) patients, dermatitis acneiform in 69 (78%)
      patients, dry skin in 39 (44%) patients, and stomatitis in 36 (40%) patients. Two
      patients (2%) had grade 4 treatment-related events (one with hypokalaemia and one
      with dyspnoea). No grade 5 toxicities were recorded. INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib 
      had encouraging clinical activity as initial systemic treatment in clinically or 
      molecularly selected patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. FUNDING: 
      Pfizer.

TI  - Risk of venous thromboembolism occurrence among adults with selected autoimmune
      diseases: a study among a U.S. cohort of commercial insurance enrollees.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among
      privately insured adults in the U.S. with one or more of the following autoimmune
      diseases: autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenic purpura
      (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Truven Health MarketScan(R) Databases, patients 
      18-64 years of age with a diagnosis of AIHA, ITP, RA, or SLE in 2007 and a sex
      and age-group matched comparison group of enrollees were followed up through 2010
      to identify VTE events. Survival curve and Cox proportional hazards analyses were
      conducted to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: Among patients with
      AIHA, ITP, RA, or SLE, or >1 of these diseases, the risk of at least one VTE
      event was 19.74, 7.72, 4.90, 9.89, and 13.35 per 1,000 person-years,
      respectively; among the comparison group, the risk was 1.91 per 1,000
      person-years. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for VTE among patients with AIHA,
      ITP, RA, or SLE, or >1 of these diseases (when compared with the comparison
      group) tended to decline over follow-up time; at 1year, the aHRs were 6.30 (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 4.44-8.94), 2.95 (95% CI: 2.18-4.00), 2.13 (95% CI:
      1.89-2.40), 4.68 (95% CI: 4.10-5.33), and 5.11 (95% CI: 4.26-6.14), respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Having AIHA, ITP, RA, or SLE, or >1 of these diseases was associated 
      with an increased likelihood of a VTE event. More research is necessary to
      develop better understanding of VTE occurrence among people with autoimmune
      diseases.

AB  - CKD patients face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, and the 
      risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) increases as kidney function declines. Risk
      factors for SCD are poorly understood and understudied among CKD patients. In the
      general population, coronary heart disease-associated risk factors are the most
      important determinants of SCD risk, but among CKD patients, there is evidence
      that these factors play a much smaller role. Complex relationships between
      CKD-specific risk factors, structural heart disease, and arrhythmic triggers
      contribute to the high risk of SCD and ventricular arrhythmias and modulate the
      effectiveness of available therapies. This review examines recent data on the
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of SCD among CKD patients and
      examines current evidence regarding the use of pharmacologic and device-based
      therapies for management of SCD risk.

AB  - A case of MR progression after single-lung transplant as a significant
      contributor to postoperative respiratory failure is reported. Pre-existing MR may
      progress due to the decompressive effects of lung transplantation on RV dimension
      and consequent alteration of MV geometry. This case highlights the importance of 
      intraoperative TEE findings, especially pertaining to valvulopathies in the
      setting of lung transplantation. Postoperative surveillance of significant
      findings is imperative when any new symptoms are being investigated.

AB  - Epigenetic modifications have been reported in a number of non-germ-line tumor
      types. Epigenetic modifications to the genome, especially DNA methylation and
      histone modifications, affect gene expression causing increased risk for cancers 
      and other diseases. We have summarized information about DNA methylation
      percentages in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) line HTB-12, alveolar cell
      carcinoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia samples and determined H3 (K27)
      methyltransferase activity in GBM and leukemia cells and made comparisons to H3
      (K27) methyltransferase activity in normal astrocyte, lung, and lymphocyte cells.
      GBM and alveolar cell carcinoma gDNA possessed lower gDNA methylation percentages
      compared to normal cells. Methyl-sensitive cut counting analysis (MSCC) showed
      fold decreases in GBM CpG methylation sites for genes PBK, KIF23, COL6A3, and
      LOX. There was no significant difference in CpG DNA methylation, but less histone
      methyltransferase activity in acute lymphocytic leukemia compared to normal
      cells. GBM possessed increased histone methyltransferase activity compared to
      normal samples. Challenges in the field in diagnosis and prognosis for cancer
      risk especially with regard to the results of this work are discussed.

TI  - Immediate disappearance of hemifacial spasm after partial removal of
      ponto-medullary junction anaplastic astrocytoma: case report.
PG  - 385-90; discussion 390
LID - 10.1007/s10143-014-0586-y [doi]
AB  - Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is generally caused by a neurovascular conflict (NC) at
      the root exit zone (REZ) of the facial nerve at the brainstem. Although a direct 
      compression to the seventh cranial nerve (CN) by the anterior inferior cerebellar
      artery (AICA) is generally the most frequent cause, secondary HFS may be related 
      to other pathological conditions. HFS due to an intracranial mass lesion is
      exceptionally rare and it has been reported in very few cases. The online
      database was searched for English-language articles reporting cases of HFS due to
      brainstem mass lesions and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in
      its genesis. A 47-year-old man affected by an anaplastic astrocytoma of the
      brainstem at the level of the ponto-medullary junction developed right HFS. He
      underwent a subtotal surgical removal of the tumor with complete resolution of
      the HFS. This is the ninth reported case of HFS caused by an intrinsic brainstem 
      tumor. The exceptional rarity of the relationship between intra-axial tumors and 
      peripheral HFS was analyzed.

TI  - Targeted delivery of tumor suppressor microRNA-1 by transferrin-conjugated
      lipopolyplex nanoparticles to patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells.
PG  - 839-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among heterogeneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, glioblastoma 
      stem cells (GSCs) is a subpopulation having a critical role in tumor initiation
      and therapy resistance. Thus targeting GSCs would be an essential step to
      completely eradicate this lethal disease. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) expression is
      deregulated in GBM patients and restoration of miR-1 by viral-vector in GBM cells
      has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor initiation and attenuate cell migration.
      Here, we show that a transferrin-targeting non-invasive nanoparticle delivery
      system (Tf-NP) can efficiently deliver miR-1 to GBM patient-derived GSC-enriched 
      sphere cultures (GBM spheres). METHODS: Delivery efficiency of the transferrin-
      targeting non-invasive nanoparticle was investigated by flow cytometry and
      further confirmed by confocal microscopy. The levels of miR-1 and its target
      molecules in GBM spheres were measured by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Migration
      capacity of Tf-NP-miR-1 treated GBM spheres were evaluated by transwell migration
      assay. RESULTS: Tf-NPmiR- 1 treatment resulted in an over 200-fold increase of
      mature miR-1 compared to free miR-1 and Tf-NP-miR negative control
      (Tf-NP-miR-NC). Transferrin-mediated NP delivery resulted in a 3-fold higher
      delivery efficiency compared to NP without transferrin modification. Tf-NP-miR-1 
      treatment on GBM spheres significantly inhibited migration of GBM spheres by
      30-50% with associated decline of MET and EGFR expression. Our data supported
      that Tf-NP could be used as an efficient and effective delivery system which has 
      high potential to benefit the development of miR-based therapeutics for GBM
      treatment.

TI  - Identification of death receptors DR4 and DR5 in HTB-12 astrocytoma cell lines
      and determination of TRAIL sensitivity.
PG  - 20-26
AB  - Astrocytomas are tumors which arise from astrocytes, cells that form the
      blood-brain barrier. There are very few drugs that successfully treat brain
      tumors. In this study, the cytotoxic effects on the HTB-12 astrocytoma cell line 
      by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were studied. 
      The presence of the TRAIL receptors, Death receptor 4 (DR4) and Death receptor 5 
      (DR5), were detected in HTB-12 cells by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
      (ELISA). Cytotoxicity assay by Trypan Blue Exclusion Method showed effective cell
      killing by TRAIL treatment. Thus, the presence of death receptors and TRAIL
      efficacy raises the therapeutic potential for this type of brain tumor.

PG  - 79-94

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM) have a dismal prognosis
      despite standard therapy, which can induce potentially deleterious side effects. 
      Arming the immune system is an alternative therapeutic approach, as its cellular 
      effectors and inherent capacity for memory can be utilized to specifically target
      invasive tumor cells, while sparing collateral damage to otherwise healthy brain 
      parenchyma. AREAS COVERED: Active immunotherapy is aimed at eliciting a specific 
      immune response against tumor antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the most
      potent activators of de novo and recall immune responses and are thus a vehicle
      for successful immunotherapy. Currently, investigators are optimizing DC vaccines
      by enhancing maturation status and migratory potential to induce more potent
      antitumor responses. An update on the most recent DC immunotherapy trials is
      provided. EXPERT OPINION: Targeting of unique antigens restricted to the tumor
      itself is the most important parameter in advancing DC vaccines. In order to
      overcome intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion observed in GBM, the future of
      DC-based therapy lies in a multi-antigenic vaccine approach. Successful targeting
      of multiple antigens will require a comprehensive understanding of all
      immunologically relevant oncological epitopes present in each tumor, thereby
      permitting a rational vaccine design.

TI  - Activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species: a 
      novel mechanism of albumin-induced tubulointerstitial inflammation.

AB  - Albuminuria is not only an important marker of chronic kidney disease but also a 
      crucial contributor to tubulointerstitial inflammation (TIF). In this study, we
      determined whether activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome is involved in
      albuminuria induced-TIF and the underlying mechanisms of inflammasome activation 
      by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). We established an
      albumin-overload induced rat nephropathy model characterised by albuminuria,
      renal infiltration of inflammatory cells, tubular dilation and atrophy. The renal
      expression levels of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, IL-1beta and IL-18 were
      significantly increased in this animal model. In vitro, albumin time- and
      dose-dependently increased the expression levels of the Nlrp3 inflammasome,
      IL-1beta and IL18. Moreover, the silencing of the Nlrp3 gene or the use of the
      caspase-1 inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk significantly attenuated the albumin-induced
      increase in IL-1beta and IL-18 expression in HK2 cells. In addition, mROS
      generation was elevated by albumin stimulation, whereas the ROS scavenger
      N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) inhibited Nlrp3 expression and the release of IL-1beta 
      and IL-18. In kidney biopsy specimens obtained from patients with IgA
      nephropathy, Nlrp3 expression was localised to the proximal tubular epithelial
      cells, and this result is closely correlated with the extent of proteinuria and
      TIF. In summary, this study demonstrates that albuminuria may serve as an
      endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that stimulates TIF via the
      mROS-mediated activation of the cytoplasmic Nlrp3 inflammasome.

TI  - Stage 1 hybrid palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome--assessment of

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hybrid palliation is an alternative to Norwood stage 1 for the initial
      management of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Contemporary multicenter hybrid
      use and institutional/patient factors associated with hybrid use relative to the 
      Norwood have not been evaluated. We describe hybrid use in relation to
      institutional volume, patient factors, and short-term outcomes. METHODS: Infants 
      aged 60 days or less listed in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart 
      Surgery Database (2010-2012) undergoing initial palliation of hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome were included. Annual institutional hybrid use rates were
      calculated: [hybrid procedures/(Norwood + hybrid + transplant procedures)].
      In-hospital outcomes for primary hybrid and primary Norwood were compared and
      stratified by high (defined as >/=50%) versus low (defined as </=10%)
      institutional hybrid use. RESULTS: Of 1728 patients (100 centers), most (n =
      1496, 87%) underwent an index Norwood; 232 patients (13%) underwent an index
      hybrid procedure. Preoperative patient risk factors were more prevalent in
      patients undergoing the hybrid procedure. Only 13 of 100 institutions were high
      hybrid users, and these tended to have lower annual hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome index case volume. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher for the
      hybrid compared with the Norwood procedure (30% vs 16%; P < .001). In-hospital
      mortality for the hybrid procedure was not associated with hybrid use (26% among 
      institutions with low use vs 28% among institutions with high use). However,
      centers with high hybrid use had higher mortality after the Norwood (43%)
      compared with centers with low hybrid use (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Few centers
      currently select the hybrid procedure for most infants with hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome. Although unadjusted in-hospital hybrid mortality is higher than
      Norwood mortality, potential risk factors are more prevalent among hybrid cases. 
      Institutions with higher hybrid use have lower hypoplastic left heart syndrome
      case volume and higher Norwood mortality.

AB  - Seven organorhenium pentylcarbonate compounds (PC1-PC7) have been synthesized.
      DNA-binding studies of the PC-series compounds using electronic spectroscopy and 
      gel electrophoresis suggest that the compounds presumably bind to DNA in an
      intercalative mode. The intrinsic binding constants for PC4, PC6, and PC7 were
      found to be 1.6 x 10(4), 3.9 x 10(4), and 4.2 x 10(4) M(-1), respectively. The
      X-ray structure determinations and density functional theory calculations
      indicate that the polypyridyl ligands in the compounds are nearly planar
      facilitating DNA binding through an intercalation mechanism. Cytotoxicity studies
      of 10 microM pentylcarbonate compounds against HTB-12 human astrocytoma brain
      cancer cells were studied for 48 h. It was observed that each of the
      pentylcarbonate compounds is active against the cancer cells. However, under
      analogous conditions, CRL-2005 rat astrocyte normal brain cells are not affected 
      significantly.

TI  - Abiraterone acetate for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer progressing after chemotherapy: final analysis of a multicentre,
      open-label, early-access protocol trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the final analysis of the phase 3 COU-AA-301 study, abiraterone
      acetate plus prednisone significantly prolonged overall survival compared with
      prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      progressing after chemotherapy. Here, we present the final analysis of an
      early-access protocol trial that was initiated after completion of COU-AA-301 to 
      enable worldwide preapproval access to abiraterone acetate in patients with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after chemotherapy.
      METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, early-access protocol trial in 23
      countries. We enrolled patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
      cancer progressing after taxane chemotherapy. Participants received oral doses of
      abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisone (5 mg twice a day) in 28-day
      cycles until disease progression, development of sustained side-effects, or
      abiraterone acetate becoming available in the respective country. The primary
      outcome was the number of adverse events arising during study treatment and
      within 30 days of discontinuation. Efficacy measures (time to prostate-specific
      antigen [PSA] progression and time to clinical progression) were gathered to
      guide treatment decisions. We included in our analysis all patients who received 
      at least one dose of abiraterone acetate. This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217697. FINDINGS: Between Nov 17, 2010, and Sept 
      30, 2013, 2314 patients were enrolled into the early-access protocol trial.
      Median follow-up was 5.7 months (IQR 3.5-10.6). 952 (41%) patients had a grade 3 
      or 4 treatment-related adverse event, and grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events
      were recorded in 585 (25%) people. The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events
      were hepatotoxicity (188 [8%]), hypertension (99 [4%]), cardiac disorders (52
      [2%]), osteoporosis (31 [1%]), hypokalaemia (28 [1%]), and fluid retention or
      oedema (23 [1%]). 172 (7%) patients discontinued the study because of adverse
      events (64 [3%] were drug-related), as assessed by the investigator, and 171 (7%)
      people died. The funder assessed causes of death, which were due to disease
      progression (85 [4%]), an unrelated adverse experience (72 [3%]), and unknown
      reasons (14 [1%]). Of the 86 deaths not attributable to disease progression, 18
      (<1%) were caused by a drug-related adverse event, as assessed by the
      investigator. Median time to PSA progression was 8.5 months (95% CI 8.3-9.7) and 
      median time to clinical progression was 12.7 months (11.8-13.8). INTERPRETATION: 
      No new safety signals or unexpected adverse events were found in this
      early-access protocol trial to assess abiraterone acetate for patients with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed after
      chemotherapy. Future work is needed to ascertain the most effective regimen of
      abiraterone acetate to optimise patients' outcomes. FUNDING: Janssen Research &
      Development.

AB  - Children with omphalocele, exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal defects
      complex present with the most severe form of birth defects in the
      exstrophy-epispadias spectrum. Prenatal diagnosis is difficult, but improved
      survival over the past several decades makes understanding the potential anatomic
      manifestations imperative for expeditious and appropriate surgical care. The
      upper urinary tract is often normal in children with omphalocele, exstrophy,
      imperforate anus, and spinal defects complex, but malposition of one of the
      kidneys has previously been reported. We present the first case of bilateral

AB  - Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive cancer with poor
      prognosis, and an overall survival of 6 to 7 months with optimal therapies. The
      NovoTTF-100A System is a novel antimitotic cancer therapy recently approved for
      the treatment of recurrent GBM, based on phase III (EF-11) trial results. The
      Patient Registry Dataset (PRiDe) is a post-marketing registry of all recurrent
      GBM patients who received NovoTTF Therapy in a real-world, clinical practice
      setting in the United States between 2011 and 2013. Data were collected from all 
      adult patients with recurrent GBM who began commercial NovoTTF Therapy in the
      United States between October 2011 and November 2013. All patients provided
      written consent before treatment was started. Overall survival (OS) curves were
      constructed for PRiDe using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median OS in PRiDe was
      compared for patients stratified by average daily compliance (>/=75% v<75% per
      day) and other prognostic variables. Adverse events were also evaluated. Data
      from 457 recurrent GBM patients who received NovoTTF Therapy in 91 US cancer
      centers were analyzed. More patients in PRiDe than the EF-11 trial received
      NovoTTF Therapy for first recurrence (33% v 9%) and had received prior
      bevacizumab therapy (55.1% v 19%). Median OS was significantly longer with
      NovoTTF Therapy in clinical practice (PRiDe data set) than in the EF-11 trial
      (9.6 v 6.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.86, P = .0003). One- and 2-year OS
      rates were more than double for NovoTTF Therapy patients in PRiDe than in the
      EF-11 trial (1-year: 44% v 20%; 2-year: 30% v 9%). First and second versus third 
      and subsequent recurrences, high Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and no prior
      bevacizumab use were favorable prognostic factors. No unexpected adverse events
      were detected in PRiDe. As in the EF-11 trial, the most frequent adverse events
      were mild to moderate skin reactions associated with application of the NovoTTF
      Therapy transducer arrays. Results from PRiDe, together with those previously
      reported in the EF-11 trial, indicate that NovoTTF Therapy offers clinical
      benefit to patients with recurrent GBM. NovoTTF Therapy has high patient
      tolerability and favorable safety profile in the real-world, clinical practice
      setting.

      multiforme.
PG  - 679-90
LID - 10.2217/imt.14.21 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive glial
      cell-derived primary tumor. Current standard of care for patients with GBM
      includes maximal tumor resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide
      chemotherapy, increasing median overall survival to a mere 15 months from
      diagnosis. Because these therapies are inherently nonspecific, there is an
      increased likelihood of off-target and incomplete effects; therefore, targeted
      modalities are required for enhanced safety and efficacy. Rindopepimut is
      emerging as a safe and potentially effective drug for the treatment of GBM.
      Rindopepimut consists of a 14-mer peptide that spans the length of EGF receptor
      variant III, a mutant variant of EGF receptor found on approximately 30% of
      primary GBM, conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin.
      Vaccination with rindopepimut has been shown to specifically eliminate cells
      expressing EGF receptor variant III. Phase II clinical trials have suggested that
      vaccination of newly diagnosed GBM patients with rindopepimut plus adjuvant
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor results in prolonged
      progression-free and overall survival with minimal toxicity. This review will
      outline the development of rindopepimut, as well as the current status of this
      vaccine.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of small intestinal
      submucosa (SIS) application on the parathyroid autotransplantation in a rat model
      of hypoparathyroidism. The rats were divided into four groups: NC (no procedure, 
      n = 5), PTX (total parathyroidectomy, n = 6), PT (total parathyroidectomy and
      parathyroid autotransplantation, n = 10) and PT + SIS group (total
      parathyroidectomy and parathyroid autotransplantation with SIS, n = 10). The
      levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorous were measured on 0,
      3, 7, 21, 56 and 84 days after surgery. PTH level was expressed as median
      (interquartile range) and histological and immunohistochemical examinations were 
      performed. PTH levels were significantly decreased to "not detectable level" from
      day 3 in PTX group. PTH was not detected in both PT and PT + SIS groups on the
      21st day. On the 56th day, PTH levels were increased in both groups: 3 out of 8
      rats (37.5%) in the PT group, 6 out of 9 rats (66.7%) in the PT + SIS group. The 
      PTH level was fully recovered to its preoperative range on the day 84 as 6 of 8
      rats (75%) of the PT group and 7 of 9 rats (77.8%) of the PT + SIS group were
      recovered; the PTH levels were 117.84 and 178.36 pg/ml, respectively. The
      neo-vascularization was well observed around the parathyroid tissue, and the
      number of new vessels formed was higher in the PT + SIS group (15 vessels/high
      power field) as compared to the PT group (10 vessels/high power field). This
      study showed the feasibility and the treatment effect of SIS as the success rate 
      of autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue was significantly increased without 
      severe inflammatory response in hypothyroidism animal model.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Discrimination of biliary atresia (BA) from other causes of neonatal 
      cholestasis (NC) is challenging. We aimed to analyze the clinicopathological
      findings in cholestatic infants who were provisionally diagnosed with BA and then
      excluded by intraoperative cholangiography compared with those with a definitive 
      diagnosis of BA and to shed light on common misdiagnoses of BA. METHODS: We
      retrospectively analyzed the data of infants diagnosed preoperatively with BA and
      referred to surgery between the years 2009 and 2013. On the basis of
      intraoperative cholangiography results, infants were divided into those with a
      definitive diagnosis of BA and those misdiagnosed with BA. RESULTS: Out of 147
      infants, there was a misdiagnosis of BA in 10 (6.8%) infants. Alanine
      transaminase was significantly higher in the non-BA group, whereas other clinical
      and laboratory findings were comparable in both groups. Hepatomegaly and abnormal
      gallbladder in ultrasound, and ductular proliferation and advanced grades of
      portal fibrosis in liver biopsy were significantly higher in infants with BA.
      However, giant cells were more common in the non-BA infants. Nonetheless, the
      frequency of clay stool, hepatomegaly, abnormal gallbladder, ductular
      proliferation, and advanced portal fibrosis was remarkable (100, 70, 40, 70, and 
      50%, respectively) in the misdiagnosed infants. The misdiagnoses were idiopathic 
      neonatal hepatitis, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3,
      cytomegalovirus hepatitis, Alagille syndrome, and a cholangitic form of
      congenital hepatic fibrosis. CONCLUSION: A meticulous preoperative workup should 
      be performed to exclude other causes of NC even if signs of BA are present,
      especially if features such as giant cells in histopathology are present. This
      involves completing the NC workup in parallel involving all common causes of NC
      rather than performing them in series to avoid loss of valuable time and efforts.

TI  - Computer-extracted MR imaging features are associated with survival in
      glioblastoma patients.
PG  - 483-8
LID - 10.1007/s11060-014-1580-5 [doi]
AB  - Automatic survival prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM) could result in improved
      treatment planning for the patient. The purpose of this research is to
      investigate the association of survival in GBM patients with tumor features in
      pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) images assessed using a fully automatic
      computer algorithm. MR imaging data for 68 patients from two US institutions were
      used in this study. The images were obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive. A
      fully automatic computer vision algorithm was applied to segment the images and
      extract eight imaging features from the MRI studies. The features included tumor 
      side, proportion of enhancing tumor, proportion of necrosis, T1/FLAIR ratio,
      major axis length, minor axis length, tumor volume, and thickness of enhancing
      margin. We constructed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
      and used a likelihood ratio test to establish whether the imaging features are
      prognostic of survival. We also evaluated the individual prognostic value of each
      feature through multivariate analysis using the multivariate Cox model and
      univariate analysis using univariate Cox models for each feature. We found that
      the automatically extracted imaging features were predictive of survival (p =
      0.031). Multivariate analysis of individual features showed that two individual
      features were predictive of survival: proportion of enhancing tumor (p = 0.013), 
      and major axis length (p = 0.026). Univariate analysis indicated the same two
      features as significant (p = 0.021, and p = 0.017 respectively). We conclude that
      computer-extracted MR imaging features can be used for survival prognosis in GBM 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The feasibility of an interventional clinical trial in idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using death and hospitalization as primary end points is
      an area of uncertainty. Using data from a large well-characterized clinical trial
      population, this article aims to illustrate the impact of cohort enrichment and
      study duration on sample size requirements for IPF clinical trials in which death
      alone or death plus hospitalization serve as the primary end point. METHODS:
      Event rate estimates for death and hospitalization were determined from patients 
      enrolled in National Institutes of Health-sponsored IPF Clinical Research Network
      clinical trials. Standard equations were applied to estimate the total sample
      size required for varying gender, age, and pulmonary function (GAP) stage-based
      cohorts. RESULTS: Risk estimates for death and hospitalization in the clinical
      trial cohort were substantially lower than those published. An IPF trial with
      death as its primary end point enrolling subjects designated as GAP stage 1 and 2
      over 1 year with a minimum follow-up of 1 year would require an estimated 7,986
      subjects to achieve 90% power for a hazard ratio of 0.70. Alternatively, an IPF
      trial with death plus hospitalization as its primary end point enrolling subjects
      with GAP stage 2 and 3 over 2 years with a minimum follow-up of 1 year would
      require an estimated 794 subjects for the same power and hazard ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: Study design decisions, in particular cohort enrichment strategies, 
      have a substantial impact on sample size requirements for IPF clinical trials
      using time-to-event primary end points such as death and death plus
      hospitalization.

      antigens.
PG  - 2047-61
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2014.947266 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malignant gliomas (MGs) represent the most common primary brain
      tumors in adults, the most deadly of which is grade IV glioblastoma. Patients
      with glioblastoma undergoing current standard-of-care therapy have a median
      survival of 12 - 15 months. AREAS COVERED: Over the past 25 years, there have
      been modest advancements in the treatment of MGs. Assessment of therapeutic
      responses has continued to evolve to account for the increasing number of agents 
      being tested in the clinic. Currently approved therapies for primary tumors have 
      been extended for use in the setting of recurrent disease with modest efficacy.
      Agents initially approved for recurrent gliomas have begun to demonstrate
      efficacy against de novo tumors but will ultimately need to be evaluated in
      future studies for scheduling, timing and dosing relative to chemotherapy. EXPERT
      OPINION: Screening and identification of tumor-specific mutations is critical for
      the advancement of effective therapy that is both safe and precise for the
      patient. Two unique antigens found in glioblastoma are currently being employed
      as targets for immunotherapeutic vaccines, one of which has advanced to Phase III
      testing. Whole genome sequencing of MGs has yielded two other novel mutations
      that offer great promise for the development of molecular inhibitors.

AB  - Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in laboratory findings, especially in
      critically ill patients. Although the incidence is rare, drug-induced immune
      thrombocytopenia (DITP) is a serious complication that is often overlooked as a
      cause of thrombocytopenia. Over the last century, extensive research and data
      collection have been done in an attempt to better characterize DITP.
      Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is the most common DITP and has distinct
      pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options. However, other offending
      medications are less well known and have triggered many questions and constant
      search for answers. This review will discuss both drug-induced immune-mediated
      and nonimmune-mediated thrombocytopenias, with a focus on immune-mediated
      processes. Thrombocytopenia caused by chemotherapy will not be discussed in this 
      article.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compensatory hyperhidrosis is a common devastating adverse effect
      after endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for patients undergoing surgical
      treatment of primary hyperhidrosis. We sought to determine whether a correlation 
      existed in our patient population between the level and extent of sympathetic
      chain resection and the subsequent development of compensatory hyperhidrosis.
      METHODS: All patients undergoing endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy in the T2-T3, 
      T2-T4, T2-T5, or T2-T6 levels for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis at the
      University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (n = 97) from January 2004 to January
      2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Differences in the preoperative
      patient characteristics were not statistically significant among the patients
      receiving T2-T3, T2-T4, T2-T5, or T2-T6 level resections. Of the 97 included
      patients, 28 (29%) experienced transient compensatory hyperhidrosis and 4 (4%)
      complained of severe compensatory hyperhidrosis and required additional
      treatment. No operative mortalities occurred, and the morbidity was similar among
      the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had successful outcomes after undergoing
      extensive resection without changes in the incidence of compensatory
      hyperhidrosis. Therefore, we recommend performing complete and adequate resection
      for relief of symptoms in patients with primary hyperhidrosis.

AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a disease caused by dysregulation and
      hyperactivation of the immune system, and can be familial or acquired. HLH
      presenting in infancy can be rapidly fatal if not promptly recognized and
      treated. Congenital HLH can be caused by various genetic mutations or part of
      immunodeficiency syndromes. We present an infant with Griscelli syndrome and
      familial HLH with atypical genetic mutations, presenting as thrombocytopenia on
      the first day of life, cured with chemotherapy and unrelated cord blood
      transplant.

TI  - Clinical course and outcome predictors of critically ill infants with complete
      DiGeorge anomaly following thymus transplantation.
PG  - e321-6
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000000219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for PICU admission and mortality of infants 
      with complete DiGeorge anomaly treated with thymus transplantation. We
      hypothesized that age at transplantation and the presence of congenital heart
      disease would be risk factors for emergent PICU admission, and these factors plus
      development of septicemia would increase morbidity and mortality. DESIGN:
      Retrospective review. SETTING: Academic medical-surgical PICU. PATIENTS: All
      infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly treated with thymus transplantation
      between January 1, 1993, and July 1, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 71 infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly
      for thymus transplantation, and 59 infants were transplanted. Median age at
      transplantation was 5.0 months (range, 1.1-22.1 mo). After transplantation, 12 of
      59 infants (20%) required 25 emergent PICU admissions. Seven of 12 infants (58%) 
      survived to PICU discharge with six surviving 6 months posttransplantation.
      Forty-two of 59 infants (71%) transplanted had congenital heart disease, and 9 of
      12 (75%) who were admitted to the PICU had congenital heart disease. In 15 of 25 
      admissions (60%), intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary. There was
      no difference between median ventilation-free days between infants with and
      without congenital heart disease (33 d vs 23 d, p = 0.544). There was also no
      correlation between ventilation-free days and age of transplantation (R, 0.17; p 
      = 0.423). Age at transplantation and the presence of congenital heart disease
      were not associated with risk for PICU admission (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI,
      0.78-1.15 and odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.30-5.49, respectively) or PICU
      mortality (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73-1.31 and odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI,
      0.15-1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most transplanted infants did not require 
      emergent PICU admission. Age at transplantation and the presence of congenital
      heart disease were not associated with PICU admission or mortality.

AB  - Defects in ependymal (E) cells, which line the ventricle and generate
      cerebrospinal fluid flow through ciliary beating, can cause hydrocephalus.
      Dishevelled genes (Dvls) are essential for Wnt signaling, and Dvl2 has been shown
      to localize to the rootlet of motile cilia. Using the
      hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-) mouse, we show that compound genetic
      ablation of Dvls causes hydrocephalus. In hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-)
      mutants, E cells differentiated normally, but the intracellular and intercellular
      rotational alignments of ependymal motile cilia were disrupted. As a consequence,
      the fluid flow generated by the hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-) E cells
      was significantly slower than that observed in control mice. Dvls were also
      required for the proper positioning of motile cilia on the apical surface.
      Tamoxifen-induced conditional removal of Dvls in adult mice also resulted in
      defects in intracellular rotational alignment and positioning of ependymal motile
      cilia. These results suggest that Dvls are continuously required for E cell
      planar polarity and may prevent hydrocephalus.

      individuals. With a goal of ultimately investigating this bleeding heterogeneity,
      a canine model of antibody-mediated ITP was developed. Infusion of healthy dogs
      with 2F9, a murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody to the canine platelet glycoprotein 
      GPIIb (a common target of autoantibodies in ITP) resulted in profound,
      dose-dependent thrombocytopenia. Model dogs developed variable bleeding
      phenotypes, e.g. petechiae and haematuria, despite similar degrees of
      thrombocytopenia. 2F9 infusion was not associated with systemic inflammation,
      consumptive coagulopathy, or impairment of platelet function. Unexpectedly
      however, evaluation of cytokine profiles led to the identification of platelets
      as a potential source of serum interleukin-8 (IL8) in dogs. This finding was
      confirmed in humans with ITP, suggesting that platelet IL8 may be a previously
      unrecognized modulator of platelet-neutrophil crosstalk. The utility of this
      model will allow future study of bleeding phenotypic heterogeneity including the 
      role of neutrophils and endothelial cells in ITP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the tolerability and antitumor activity of trebananib plus 
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) or topotecan in recurrent
      platinum-resistant or partially platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. METHODS: In
      this open-label phase 1b study, patients received trebananib 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg
      IV QW plus PLD 50 mg/m(2) (cohorts A1 and A3, respectively) or topotecan 4
      mg/m(2) (cohorts B1 and B3, respectively). Endpoints were dose-limiting toxicity 
      (DLT; primary); treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), overall response rate,
      anti-trebananib antibodies, and pharmacokinetics (secondary). RESULTS: 103
      patients were enrolled. One patient in A1 and B1 had DLTs. Across all cohorts,
      the most common AEs were nausea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. Across both
      trebananib plus PLD cohorts (A1/A3), grade 4 AEs were pulmonary embolism, disease
      progression, and anemia. Two patients had grade 5 intestinal perforation (n=1)
      and sudden death (n=1). Across both trebananib plus topotecan cohorts (B1/B3),
      grade 4 AEs were neutropenia, hypokalemia, decreased granulocyte count, chest
      pain, dyspnea, decreased neutrophil count, and pulmonary embolism. Two patients
      had grade 5 disease progression. One patient had grade 5 pleural effusion
      associated with progressive disease. Confirmed objective response rates were
      36.0% (A1), 34.8% (A3), 16.7% (B1), and 0.0% (B3). Median progression-free
      survival duration (months) was 7.4 (A1), 7.1 (A3), 3.5 (B1), and 3.1 (B3),
      respectively. No drug-drug interactions were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Trebananib
      10mg/kg and 15 mg/kg IV QW plus PLD or topotecan appear to have acceptable
      toxicity profiles in recurrent platinum-resistant or partially platinum-sensitive
      ovarian cancer. Antitumor activity was evident across all cohorts.

      fungal metabolite, fusarochromanone.

AB  - Fungal metabolites continue to show promise as a viable class of anticancer
      agents. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the fungal
      metabolite, fusarochromanone (FC101), for its antitumor activities in
      glioblastomas, which have a median survival of less than two years and a poor
      clinical response to surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
      Using clinically applicable doses, we demonstrated that FC101 induced
      glioblastoma apoptotic cell death via caspase dependent signaling, as indicated
      by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, glioblastoma (PARP). FC101 also
      induced differential reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in glioblastoma cells, 
      contrasting a defined role of oxidative stress in apoptotic cell death observed
      with other fungal metabolites. Furthermore, the antitumorigenic effects of FC101 
      on tumor cell migration were assessed. Cell migration assays revealed that FC101 
      significantly reduced the migratory capacity of glioblastomas, which are
      incredibly invasive tumors. Taken together, the present study establishes FC101
      as a candidate anticancer agent for the cooperative treatment of glioblastomas.

PG  - 429-35
LID - 10.1007/s11060-014-1515-1 [doi]
AB  - We investigate the differences in molecular signature and clinical outcomes
      between multiple lesion glioblastoma (GBM) and single focus GBM in the modern
      treatment era. Between August 2000 and May 2010, 161 patients with GBM were
      treated with modern radiotherapy techniques. Of this group, 33 were considered to
      have multiple lesion GBM (25 multifocal and 8 multicentric). Patterns of failure,
      time to progression and overall survival were compared based on whether the tumor
      was considered a single focus or multiple lesion GBM. Genomic groupings and
      methylation status were also investigated as a possible predictor of
      multifocality in a cohort of 41 patients with available tissue for analysis.
      There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (p < 0.3)
      between the multiple lesion tumors (8.2 months) and single focus GBM (11 months).
      Progression free survival was superior in the single focus tumors (7.1 months) as
      compared to multi-focal (5.6 months, p = 0.02). For patients with single focus,
      multifocal and multicentric GBM, 81, 76 and 88 % of treatment failures occurred
      in the 60 Gy volume (p < 0.5), while 54, 72, and 38 % of treatment failures
      occurred in the 46 Gy volume (p < 0.4). Out of field failures were rare in both
      single focus and multiple foci GBM (7 vs 3 %). Genomic groupings and methylation 
      status were not found to predict for multifocality. Patterns of failure, survival
      and genomic signatures for multiple lesion GBM do not appreciably differ when
      compared to single focus tumors.

TI  - Longitudinal assessment of growth in hypoplastic left heart syndrome: results
      from the single ventricle reconstruction trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize growth between birth and age 3 years in
      infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent the Norwood procedure.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a secondary analysis using the Single Ventricle
      Reconstruction Trial database after excluding patients <37 weeks gestation
      (N=498). We determined length-for-age z score (LAZ) and weight-for-age z score
      (WAZ) at birth and age 3 years and change in WAZ over 4 clinically relevant time 
      periods. We identified correlates of change in WAZ and LAZ using multivariable
      linear regression with bootstrapping. Mean WAZ and LAZ were below average
      relative to the general population at birth (P<0.001, P=0.05, respectively) and
      age 3 years (P<0.001 each). The largest decrease in WAZ occurred between birth
      and Norwood discharge; the greatest gain occurred between stage II and 14 months.
      At age 3 years, WAZ and LAZ were <-2 in 6% and 18%, respectively. Factors
      associated with change in WAZ differed among time periods. Shunt type was
      associated with change in WAZ only in the Norwood discharge to stage II period;
      subjects with a Blalock-Taussig shunt had a greater decline in WAZ than those
      with a right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: WAZ changed
      over time and the predictors of change in WAZ varied among time periods. By age 3
      years, subjects remained small and three times as many children were short as
      were underweight (>2 SD below normal). Failure to find consistent risk factors
      supports the strategy of tailoring nutritional therapies to patient- and
      stage-specific targets. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL:

TI  - Efficacy of the seven feature, fifteen point histological scoring system and CD56
      in interpretation of liver biopsies in persistent neonatal cholestasis: a
      five-year study.
PG  - 196-200
LID - 10.4103/0377-4929.134662 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Neonatal cholestasis (NC) lasting more than 2 weeks affects one in 2500 
      live births. Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) and idiopathic neonatal
      hepatitis account for about 70% of all cases of NC. Differentiating these two
      conditions is important as patient management is very different for both the
      conditions. AIMS: To assess the usefulness of the seven-feature, 15-point
      histological scoring system in the interpretation of liver biopsy in NC and
      usefulness of immunostaining with CD56 (N-CAM) in EHBA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN:
      Retrospective study of 5 years' duration at a pediatric referral institute, where
      the case load of NC is high and definitive surgery for EHBA is undertaken after
      histological confirmation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is of a 5-year
      duration conducted between June 2007 and May 2012. A total of 210 cases of NC
      were clinically diagnosed during this period. All the slides were reviewed with
      reference to a seven-feature, 15-point histological scoring system assessing its 
      usefulness in the interpretation of liver biopsy in NC and utility of the
      immunohistochemical marker CD56 was also assessed as an aid in the
      characterization of bile ductular proliferation in EHBA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
      Statistical analysis was performed and sensitivity and specificity of the
      histological scoring system for EHBA was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 210 liver
      biopsies reviewed using the scoring system, 122 cases were diagnosed as EHBA and 
      88 cases were diagnosed as other causes of NC. The overall sensitivity of this
      scoring system was 95.5%, specificity was 93.1% and diagnostic accuracy was
      94.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The seven-feature, 15-point histological scoring system has
      good diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of liver histology in NC as
      advanced histopathological findings even at younger age require immediate
      surgery. CD-56 is a useful marker in the assessment of bile ductular
      proliferation in EHBA.

AB  - A 14-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency presented three times to 
      a medical facility over a period of 4 months with fever and headache that
      progressed to hydrocephalus and status epilepticus necessitating a medically

      next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid identified 475 of 3,063,784
      sequence reads (0.016%) corresponding to leptospira infection. Clinical assays
      for leptospirosis were negative. Targeted antimicrobial agents were administered,
      and the patient was discharged home 32 days later with a status close to his
      premorbid condition. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and serologic testing at the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subsequently confirmed evidence 
      of Leptospira santarosai infection.

TI  - Lung transplantation in telomerase mutation carriers with pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 178-87
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00060014 [doi]
AB  - Lung transplantation is the only intervention that prolongs survival in
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Telomerase mutations are the most common
      identifiable genetic cause of IPF, and at times, the telomere defect manifests in
      extrapulmonary disease such as bone marrow failure. The relevance of this genetic
      diagnosis for lung transplant management has not been examined. We gathered an
      international series of telomerase mutation carriers who underwent lung
      transplant in the U.S.A., Australia and Sweden. The median age at transplant was 
      52 years. Seven recipients are alive with a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range 
      6 months to 9 years); one died at 10 months. The most common complications were
      haematological, with recipients requiring platelet transfusion support (88%) and 
      adjustment of immunosuppressives (100%). Four recipients (50%) required dialysis 
      for tubular injury and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. These complications
      occurred at significantly higher rates relative to historic series (p<0.0001).
      Our observations support the feasibility of lung transplantation in telomerase
      mutation carriers; however, severe post-transplant complications reflecting the
      syndromic nature of their disease appear to occur at higher rates. While these
      findings need to be expanded to other cohorts, caution should be exercised when
      approaching the transplant evaluation and management of this subset of pulmonary 
      fibrosis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, Curcumin (CU)-loaded nanocarrier (NC) such as
      nanoemulsion (NE) was developed with the objective of increasing its cytotoxicity
      and bioavailability through lymphatic transport by enhancing its solubility and
      intestinal permeability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the area obtained in
      pseudoternary phase diagram, various % combination of Labrafac Lipophile WL 1349,
      Solutol HS 15, Transcutol HP and distilled water were selected. Formulations
      which passed physical stability studies were selected for further studies such as
      globule size, zeta potential, in vitro release, ex vivo permeation, in vitro
      lipolysis studies, bioavailability studies and cytotoxicity against glioblastoma 
      cells (U-87). RESULT AND DISCUSSION: The optimized NC (NE-SB1) had small average 
      globule diameter of 67 +/- 6 nm with zeta potential of -37 +/- 2.5 mv which
      indicated long-term dispersion stability. During in vitro lipolysis study, the
      digestion rate of medium chain triglycerides increased with decreased globule
      diameter. Statistically significant difference was found in AUC0-inf of NC
      formulation (p < 0.05) compared to CU suspension. The relative bioavailability of
      NC was found 11.88 +/- 0.47 with respect to CU suspension. During cytotoxicity
      studies, IC50 of CU solution on U87 cells was found 24.23 microM, while for the
      NE- SB1 it was 16.41 microM. The optimized formulation was found to be stable
      during 6 months of accelerated stability. CONCLUSION: The overall results
      revealed that the CU-loaded NC is a very effective approach for enhancing the
      oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drug CU and have great potential for
      future clinical application.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate effects of prematurity on early optic nerve (ON) development
      and the usefulness of ON parameters as indicators of central nervous system (CNS)
      development and pathology. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional, longitudinal
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four preterm infants undergoing retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP) screening and 52 term infants. METHODS: We analyzed ON from
      portable handheld spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images
      (Bioptigen, Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC) of 44 preterm and 52 term infants.
      The highest-quality ON scan from either eye was selected for quantitative
      analysis. Longitudinal analysis was performed at 31-36 weeks and 37-42 weeks
      postmenstrual age (PMA). Preterm ON parameters also were assessed for correlation
      with indicators of cognitive, language, and motor development and CNS pathology. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vertical cup diameter (vCD), vertical disc diameter (vDD),
      vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCDR), cup depth, and indicators of neurocognitive
      development and CNS pathology. RESULTS: At 37-42 weeks PMA, preterm infants had
      larger vCD and vCDR than term infants (908 vs. 700 mum [P<0.001] and 0.68 vs.
      0.53 mum [P<0.001], respectively), whereas cup depth and vDD were not
      significantly different. Longitudinal changes (n = 26 preterm eyes; mean
      interval, 4.7 weeks) in vDD and in vCDR were an increase of 74 mum (P = 0.008)
      and decrease of 0.05 (P = 0.015), respectively. In preterm infants (n = 44),
      periventricular leukomalacia was associated with larger vCD (1084 vs. 828 mum; P 
      = 0.005) and vCDR (0.85 vs. 0.63; P<0.001), posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus was
      associated with shallower cup (331 vs. 456 mum; P = 0.030), and clinical magnetic
      resonance imaging was associated with larger vCDR (0.73 vs. 0.64; P = 0.023). In 
      23 preterm infants with Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores, larger vCDR
      was associated with lower cognitive scores (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: This is the 
      first analysis of ON parameters in premature infants using SD-OCT. It
      demonstrated that by age of term birth, vCD and vCDR are larger in preterm
      infants who were screened for ROP than in term infants. In this prospective pilot
      study, ON parameters in these preterm infants associate weakly with CNS pathology
      and future cognitive development. Future prospective studies with larger numbers 
      are necessary before further conclusions can be made.

      disease in clinical practice.
PG  - 1207-22

AB  - We validated the utility of SPM8 plus DARTEL (VSRAD) combined with magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) as an adjunct screening technique for dementia
      due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the posterior cingulate gyri of 228 
      subjects using VSRAD and 1H MRS in addition to conventional cerebrospinal fluid
      biomarkers at baseline. At the 3-year follow-up, the 228 subject were classified 
      as follows: 93 healthy subjects, 42 MCI-non-converters (MCI-NC), 25
      MCI-converters to AD (MCI-C), 44 AD, 8 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 5 normal 
      pressure hydrocephalus, and 11 patients with other neurological diseases. Our
      results demonstrated that subjects with increased medial temporal atrophy (MTA)
      severity on VSRAD, increased Cho/Cr, MI/Cr ratio, and decreased NAA/Cr and NAA/MI
      ratio on 1H MRS at baseline were at risk of dementia due to AD. Receiver
      operating characteristic analysis showed that severity of MTA and the NAA/MI
      ratio distinguished patients with AD and MCI-C from controls. Furthermore, the
      118 subjects without dementia and MTA showing only a decreased NAA/MI ratio at
      baseline developed to MCI-C, AD, and DLB 3 years later. 1H MRS detected
      biochemical abnormalities preceding brain atrophy and cognitive decline. VSRAD
      combined with 1H MRS may be routinely applied to screen for MCI/AD and prodromal 
      AD in clinical practice.

PG  - 233-44
LID - 10.15274/NRJ-2014-10027 [doi]
AB  - We prospectively compared the ability of neuroradiologists to diagnose
      medulloblastoma with novice raters using only apparent diffusion coefficient
      (ADC) values measured on ADC maps. One hundred and three pediatric patients with 
      pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging scans showing a posterior fossa tumor
      with histological verification were retrospectively identified from a ten-year
      period at a tertiary care medical center. A single observer measured the lowest
      ADC values in all tumors to determine the mean minimum ADC (ADCmin) value that
      provided greatest accuracy in distinguishing medulloblastomas from other tumors, 
      which was determined to be 0.66x10(-3) mm(2)/s. Imaging studies, including ADC
      maps, from 90 patients were provided to two neuroradiologists, who provided a
      diagnosis, which was later dichotomized as medulloblastoma or other. Two medical 
      students measured ADCmin within tumors and those with ADCmin < 0.66x10(-3)
      mm(2)/s were recorded as medulloblastoma; any other value was recorded as other. 
      Diagnostic accuracy was measured. ADCmin values allowed a correct identification 
      of lesions as either medulloblastoma or other in 91% of cases. After diagnoses by
      the two neuroradiologists were categorized as either medulloblastoma or other,
      their diagnoses were correct in 90% and 84% of cases, respectively. In 19 cases, 
      at least one neuroradiologist was incorrect; the addition of ADC values to
      clinical interpretation would have allowed a correct diagnosis in 63% of such
      cases. Diagnostic accuracy based on ADC values by medical students was comparable
      to that of subspecialty-trained neuroradiologists. Our findings suggest that the 
      addition of ADC values to standard film interpretation may improve the diagnostic
      rate for these tumors.

TI  - Rituximab and three dexamethasone cycles provide responses similar to splenectomy
      in women and those with immune thrombocytopenia of less than two years duration.

AB  - Adults with newly diagnosed or persistent immunothrombocytopenia frequently
      relapse upon tapering steroids; adults and children with chronic disease have an 
      even lower likelihood of lasting response. In adults with newly-diagnosed
      immunothrombocytopenia, two studies showed that dexamethasone 40 mg/day x four
      days and 4 rituximab infusions were superior to dexamethasone alone. Studies have
      also shown three cycles of dexamethasone are better than one and patients with
      persistent/chronic immunothrombocytopenia respond less well to either
      dexamethasone or rituximab. Therefore, 375 mg/m(2) x 4 rituximab was combined
      with three 4-day cycles of 28 mg/m(2) (max. 40 mg) dexamethasone at 2-week
      intervals and explored in 67 ITP patients. Best long-term response was assessed
      as complete (platelet count >/= 100 x 10(9)/L) or partial (50-99 x 10(9)/L). Only
      5 patients had not been previously treated. Fifty achieved complete (n=43, 64%)
      or partial (n=7, 10%) responses. Thirty-five of 50 responders maintained
      treatment-free platelet counts over 50 x 10(9)/L at a median 17 months (range
      4-67) projecting 44% event-free survival. Duration of immunothrombocytopenia less
      than 24 months, achieving complete responses, and being female were associated
      with better long-term response (P<0.01). Adverse events were generally
      mild-moderate, but 3 patients developed serum sickness and 2 colitis; there were 
      no sequelae. Dexamethasone could be difficult to tolerate. Fourteen patients
      became hypogammaglobulinemic and half had increased frequency of minor
      infections; 9 of 12 evaluable patients recovered their IgG levels. Rituximab
      combined with three cycles of dexamethasone provides apparently better results to
      reported findings with rituximab alone, dexamethasone alone, or the combination
      with one cycle of dexamethasone. The results suggest medical cure may be
      achievable in immunothrombocytopenia, especially in women and in patients within 
      two years of diagnosis. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:02050581).

AB  - Homozygosity for a recurrent 290 kb deletion of NPHP1 is the most frequent cause 
      of isolated nephronophthisis (NPHP) in humans. A deletion of the same genomic
      interval has also been detected in individuals with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), and 
      in the mouse, Nphp1 interacts genetically with Ahi1, a known JBTS locus. Given
      these observations, we investigated the contribution of NPHP1 in Bardet-Biedl
      syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy of intermediate severity. By using a combination of 
      array-comparative genomic hybridization, TaqMan copy number assays, and
      sequencing, we studied 200 families affected by BBS. We report a homozygous NPHP1
      deletion CNV in a family with classical BBS that is transmitted with
      autosomal-recessive inheritance. Further, we identified heterozygous NPHP1
      deletions in two more unrelated persons with BBS who bear primary mutations at
      another BBS locus. In parallel, we identified five families harboring an SNV in
      NPHP1 resulting in a conserved missense change, c.14G>T (p.Arg5Leu), that is
      enriched in our Hispanic pedigrees; in each case, affected individuals carried
      additional bona fide pathogenic alleles in another BBS gene. In vivo functional
      modeling in zebrafish embryos demonstrated that c.14G>T is a loss-of-function
      variant, and suppression of nphp1 in concert with each of the primary BBS loci
      found in our NPHP1-positive pedigrees exacerbated the severity of the phenotype. 
      These results suggest that NPHP1 mutations are probably rare primary causes of
      BBS that contribute to the mutational burden of the disorder.

LID - 10.1177/0022034514529150 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary diseases affecting the skeleton are heterogeneous in etiology and
      severity. Though many of these conditions are individually rare, the total number
      of people affected is great. These disorders often include
      dental-oral-craniofacial (DOC) manifestations, but the combination of the rarity 
      and lack of in-depth reporting often limit our understanding and ability to
      diagnose and treat affected individuals. In this review, we focus on dental,
      oral, and craniofacial manifestations of rare bone diseases. Discussed are
      defects in 4 key physiologic processes in bone/tooth formation that serve as
      models for the understanding of other diseases in the skeleton and DOC complex:
      progenitor cell differentiation (fibrous dysplasia), extracellular matrix
      production (osteogenesis imperfecta), mineralization (familial tumoral
      calcinosis/hyperostosis hyperphosphatemia syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, and
      hypophosphatasia), and bone resorption (Gorham-Stout disease). For each
      condition, we highlight causative mutations (when known), etiopathology in the
      skeleton and DOC complex, and treatments. By understanding how these 4 foci are
      subverted to cause disease, we aim to improve the identification of genetic,
      molecular, and/or biologic causes, diagnoses, and treatment of these and other
      rare bone conditions that may share underlying mechanisms of disease.

TI  - Intratumoral decorin gene delivery by AAV vector inhibits brain glioblastomas and
      prolongs survival of animals by inducing cell differentiation.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant cancer in the central nervous
      system with poor clinical prognosis. In this study, we investigated the
      therapeutic effect of an anti-cancer protein, decorin, by delivering it into a
      xenograft U87MG glioma tumor in the brain of nude mice through an
      adeno-associated viral (AAV2) gene delivery system. Decorin expression from the
      AAV vector in vitro inhibited cultured U87MG cell growth by induction of cell
      differentiation. Intracranial injection of AAV-decorin vector to the
      glioma-bearing nude mice in vivo significantly suppressed brain tumor growth and 
      prolonged survival when compared to control non-treated mice bearing the same
      U87MG tumors. Proteomics analysis on protein expression profiles in the U87MG
      glioma cells after AAV-mediated decorin gene transfer revealed up- and
      down-regulation of important proteins. Differentially expressed proteins between 
      control and AAV-decorin-transduced cells were identified through MALDI-TOF MS and
      database mining. We found that a number of important proteins that are involved
      in apoptosis, transcription, chemotherapy resistance, mitosis, and fatty acid
      metabolism have been altered as a result of decorin overexpression. These
      findings offer valuable insight into the mechanisms of the anti-glioblastoma
      effects of decorin. In addition, AAV-mediated decorin gene delivery warrants
      further investigation as a potential therapeutic approach for brain tumors.

TI  - miR-7 inhibits glioblastoma growth by simultaneously interfering with the
      PI3K/ATK and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways.
PG  - 1571-80
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2014.2322 [doi]
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates glioblastoma cell
      proliferation, survival, migration and invasion and plays a key role in tumor
      progression. We show that microRNA-7 (miR-7) is a common regulator of the
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/ATK and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
      kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, both of which 
      are launched by EGFR through its two direct targets, the transcription factors
      PI3K and Raf-1, respectively. Enforced expression of miR-7 markedly decreased
      expression of PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK 1/2, and cyclin
      D1, as well as slightly reduced expression of EGFR. Forced expression of PI3K or 
      Raf-1 transcripts lacking the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) partially reversed 
      the effects of miR-7 on cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest in glioma
      cells. Additionally, transient expression of miR-7 in glioblastoma cells strongly
      inhibited in vivo glioblastoma xenograft growth. We conclude that miR-7 is a
      potential tumor suppressor in glioblastoma that acts by targeting multiple
      oncogenes related to the downstream pathway of EGFR and may serve as a novel
      therapeutic target for malignant gliomas.

TI  - Complement factor H gene associations with end-stage kidney disease in African
      Americans.
PG  - 1409-14
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfu036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the complement factor H gene (CFH) region associate with
      renal-limited mesangial proliferative forms of glomerulonephritis including IgA
      nephropathy (IgAN), dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN).
      Lack of kidney biopsies could lead to under diagnosis of CFH-associated end-stage
      kidney disease (ESKD) in African Americans (AAs), with incorrect attribution to
      other causes. A prior genome-wide association study in AAs with non-diabetic ESKD
      implicated an intronic CFH single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). METHODS:
      Thirteen CFH SNPs (8 exonic, 2 synonymous, 2 3'UTR, and the previously associated
      intronic variant rs379489) were tested for association with common forms of
      non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes-associated (T2D) ESKD in 3770 AAs (1705 with
      non-diabetic ESKD, 1305 with T2D-ESKD, 760 controls). Most cases lacked kidney
      biopsies; those with known IgAN, DDD or C3GN were excluded. RESULTS: Adjusting
      for age, gender, ancestry and apolipoprotein L1 gene risk variants, single SNP
      analyses detected 6 CFH SNPs (5 exonic and the intronic variant) as significantly
      associated with non-diabetic ESKD (P = 0.002-0.01), three of these SNPs were also
      associated with T2D-ESKD. Weighted CFH locus-wide Sequence Kernel Association
      Testing (SKAT) in non-diabetic ESKD (P = 0.00053) and T2D-ESKD (P = 0.047)
      confirmed significant evidence of association. CONCLUSIONS: CFH was associated
      with commonly reported etiologies of ESKD in the AA population. These results
      suggest that a subset of cases with ESKD clinically ascribed to the effects of
      hypertension or glomerulosclerosis actually have CFH-related forms of mesangial
      proliferative glomerulonephritis. Genetic testing may prove useful to identify
      the causes of renal-limited kidney disease in patients with ESKD who lack renal
      biopsies.

PG  - 438
LID - 10.1007/s11910-014-0438-8 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of elevated intracranial
      pressure due to an unknown cause. In most cases, IIH can be managed with medical 
      therapy and weight reduction. Surgical treatment of IIH is reserved for patients 
      who cannot tolerate medical therapy, are nonadherent to medical therapy, develop 
      progressive symptoms despite maximal medical therapy, or present with fulminant
      visual loss. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the surgical treatment of IIH, and our current knowledge of the efficacy and
      complications of these procedures is based on retrospective and observational
      studies. This review discusses the indications for surgical intervention in IIH
      and provides an overview of the recently published data on the efficacy and
      complications of these interventions. A surgical management algorithm is also
      presented to guide the clinician when evaluating a patient with IIH.

TI  - Laterality defects other than situs inversus totalis in primary ciliary
      dyskinesia: insights into situs ambiguus and heterotaxy.
PG  - 1176-1186
LID - S0012-3692(15)52385-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1378/chest.13-1704 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motile cilia dysfunction causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD),
      situs inversus totalis (SI), and a spectrum of laterality defects, yet the
      prevalence of laterality defects other than SI in PCD has not been prospectively 
      studied. METHODS: In this prospective study, participants with suspected PCD were
      referred to our multisite consortium. We measured nasal nitric oxide (nNO) level,
      examined cilia with electron microscopy, and analyzed PCD-causing gene mutations.
      Situs was classified as (1) situs solitus (SS), (2) SI, or (3) situs ambiguus
      (SA), including heterotaxy. Participants with hallmark electron microscopic
      defects, biallelic gene mutations, or both were considered to have classic PCD.
      RESULTS: Of 767 participants (median age, 8.1 years, range, 0.1-58 years),
      classic PCD was defined in 305, including 143 (46.9%), 125 (41.0%), and 37
      (12.1%) with SS, SI, and SA, respectively. A spectrum of laterality defects was
      identified with classic PCD, including 2.6% and 2.3% with SA plus complex or
      simple cardiac defects, respectively; 4.6% with SA but no cardiac defect; and
      2.6% with an isolated possible laterality defect. Participants with SA and
      classic PCD had a higher prevalence of PCD-associated respiratory symptoms vs SA 
      control participants (year-round wet cough, P < .001; year-round nasal

      P = .021) and lower nNO levels (median, 12 nL/min vs 252 nL/min; P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: At least 12.1% of patients with classic PCD have SA and laterality
      defects ranging from classic heterotaxy to subtle laterality defects. Specific
      clinical features of PCD and low nNO levels help to identify PCD in patients with
      laterality defects. TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00323167; URL:

TI  - Hemolytic anemia in two patients with glioblastoma multiforme: A possible
      interaction between vorinostat and dapsone.
PG  - 220-3
LID - 10.1177/1078155214524085 [doi]
AB  - Patients undergoing treatment for glioblastoma multiforme are routinely placed on
      prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia because of
      significant therapy-induced lymphopenia. In patients with sulfa allergies,
      dapsone prophylaxis is often used due to its efficacy, long half-life, cost
      effectiveness, and general safety at low doses. However, dapsone may uncommonly
      induce a hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients deficient of
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This hemolysis is thought to be a result of
      oxidative stress on red blood cells induced by dapsone metabolites which produce 
      reactive oxygen species that disrupt the red blood cell membrane and promote
      splenic sequestration. A single case report of dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia
      in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme has been reported. We present two
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia
      shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone
      deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. There are several potential
      mechanisms by which histone deacetylase inhibition may alter dapsone metabolism
      including changes in hepatic acetylation or N-glucuronidation leading to an
      increase in the bioavailability of dapsone's hematotoxic metabolites. In
      addition, vorinostat may lead to increased hemolysis through inhibition of heat
      shock protein-90, a chaperone protein that maintains the integrity of the red
      blood cell membrane cytoskeleton. The potential interaction between dapsone and
      vorinostat may have important clinical implications as more than 10 clinical
      trials evaluating drug combinations with vorinostat in patients with malignant
      glioma are either ongoing or planned in North America.

TI  - Evaluation of apparent diffusion coefficient thresholds for diagnosis of
      medulloblastoma using diffusion-weighted imaging.
PG  - 63-74
AB  - We assess a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) analysis technique as a potential
      basis for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. A
      retrospective medical record search identified 103 children (mean age: 87 months)
      with posterior fossa tumors having a total of 126 preoperative MR scans with DWI.
      The minimum ADC (ADCmin) and normalized ADC (nADC) values [ratio of ADCmin values
      in tumor compared to normal tissue] were measured by a single observer blinded to
      diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to
      determine the optimal threshold for which the nADC and ADCmin values would
      predict tumor histology. Inter-rater reliability for predicting tumor type was
      evaluated using values measured by two additional observers. At histology, ten
      tumor types were identified, with astrocytoma (n=50), medulloblastoma (n=33), and
      ependymoma (n=9) accounting for 89%. Mean ADCmin (0.54 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and nADC
      (0.70) were lowest for medulloblastoma. Mean ADCmin (1.28 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and
      nADC (1.64) were highest for astrocytoma. For the ROC analysis, the area under
      the curve when discriminating medulloblastoma from other tumors using nADC was
      0.939 and 0.965 when using ADCmin. The optimal ADCmin threshold was 0.66 x 10(-3)
      mm(2)/s, which yielded an 86% positive predictive value, 97% negative predictive 
      value, and 93% accuracy. Inter-observer variability was very low, with near
      perfect agreement among all observers in predicting medulloblastoma. Our data
      indicate that both ADCmin and nADC could serve as the basis for a CAD program to 
      distinguish medulloblastoma from other posterior fossa tumors with a high degree 
      of accuracy.

TI  - Human regulatory T cells kill tumor cells through granzyme-dependent cytotoxicity
      upon retargeting with a bispecific antibody.
PG  - 163
LID - 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-13-0049 [doi]
AB  - A major mechanism by which human regulatory T cells (T(regs)) have been shown to 
      suppress and kill autologous immune cells is through the granzyme-perforin
      pathway. However, it is unknown whether T(regs) also possess the capacity to kill
      tumor cells using similar mechanisms. Bispecific antibodies (bscAbs) have emerged
      as a promising class of therapeutics that activate T cells against tumor antigens
      without the need for classical MHC-restricted TCR recognition. Here, we show that
      a bscAb targeting the tumor-specific mutation of the epidermal growth factor
      receptor, EGFRvIII, redirects human CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T(regs) to kill
      glioblastoma (GBM) cells. This activity was significantly abrogated by inhibitors
      of the granzyme-perforin pathway. Notably, analyses of human primary GBM also
      displayed diffuse infiltration of granzyme-expressing FoxP3(+) T cells. Together,
      these data suggest that despite their known suppressive functions,
      tumor-infiltrating T(regs) possess potent cytotoxic mechanisms that can be
      co-opted for efficient tumor cell lysis.

TI  - Adherence to antiemetic guidelines in patients with malignant glioma: a quality
      improvement project to translate evidence into practice.
PG  - 1897-905
LID - 10.1007/s00520-014-2136-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A quality improvement project was implemented to improve adherence to
      evidence-based antiemetic guidelines for malignant glioma patients treated with
      moderately emetic chemotherapy (MEC). Poorly controlled chemotherapy-induced
      nausea and vomiting (CINV) reduce cancer treatment efficacy and significantly
      impair cancer patients' quality of life (QOL). A review of Duke University
      Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC)'s usual practice demonstrates a 
      high incidence (45%) of CINV, despite premedication with short-acting
      5-HT3-serotonin-receptor antagonists (5-HT3-RAs). National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN)'s evidence-based guidelines recommend the combination of the
      long-acting 5-HT3-RA palonosetron (PAL) and dexamethasone (DEX) for the
      prevention of acute and delayed CINV with MEC. Low adherence (58%) to antiemetic 
      guidelines may have explained our high CINV incidence. METHODS: One-sample
      binomial test, quasi-experimental design, evaluated a combination intervention
      that included a provider education session; implementation of risk-assessment
      tool with computerized, standardized antiemetic guideline order sets; and a
      monthly audit-feedback strategy. Post-implementation adherence to evidence-based 
      antiemetic order sets and patient outcomes were measured and compared to baseline
      and historical data. Primary outcome was the guideline order set adherence rate. 
      Secondary outcomes included nausea/vomiting rates and QOL. RESULTS: Adherence to 
      ordering MEC guideline antiemetics increased significantly, from 58% to a
      sustained 90%, with associated improvement in nausea/vomiting. In acute and
      delayed phases, 75 and 84% of patients, respectively, did not experience CINV.
      There was no significant change in QOL. CONCLUSION: Combination intervention and 
      audit-feedback strategy to translate evidence into oncology practice improved and
      sustained adherence to antiemetic guidelines. Adherence corresponded with
      effective nausea/vomiting control and preserved QOL in patients with malignant
      gliomas.

TI  - A randomized trial of bevacizumab for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
PG  - 699-708
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1308573 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concurrent treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by
      maintenance temozolomide is the standard of care for patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against
      vascular endothelial growth factor A, is currently approved for recurrent
      glioblastoma. Whether the addition of bevacizumab would improve survival among
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is not known. METHODS: In this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we treated adults who had
      centrally confirmed glioblastoma with radiotherapy (60 Gy) and daily
      temozolomide. Treatment with bevacizumab or placebo began during week 4 of
      radiotherapy and was continued for up to 12 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy.
      At disease progression, the assigned treatment was revealed, and bevacizumab
      therapy could be initiated or continued. The trial was designed to detect a 25%
      reduction in the risk of death and a 30% reduction in the risk of progression or 
      death, the two coprimary end points, with the addition of bevacizumab. RESULTS: A
      total of 978 patients were registered, and 637 underwent randomization. There was
      no significant difference in the duration of overall survival between the
      bevacizumab group and the placebo group (median, 15.7 and 16.1 months,
      respectively; hazard ratio for death in the bevacizumab group, 1.13).
      Progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group (10.7 months vs.
      7.3 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.79). There were modest
      increases in rates of hypertension, thromboembolic events, intestinal
      perforation, and neutropenia in the bevacizumab group. Over time, an increased
      symptom burden, a worse quality of life, and a decline in neurocognitive function
      were more frequent in the bevacizumab group. CONCLUSIONS: First-line use of
      bevacizumab did not improve overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma. Progression-free survival was prolonged but did not reach the
      prespecified improvement target. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute;

TI  - Identification of the Transmembrane Glucose Regulated Protein 78 as a Biomarker
      for the Brain Cancer Glioblastoma Multiforme by Gene Expression and Proteomic
      Studies.
LID - 1000126 [pii]
AB  - The prognosis of patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most malignant 
      adult glial brain tumor, remains poor in spite of advances in treatment
      procedures, including surgical resection, irradiation and chemotherapy. Genetic
      heterogeneity of GBM warrants extensive studies to gain a thorough understanding 
      of the biology of this tumor. While there have been several studies of global
      transcript profiling of glioma with the identification of gene signatures for
      diagnosis and disease management, translation into clinics is yet to happen. In
      the present study, we report a novel proteomic approach by using two-dimensional 
      difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by spot picking and analysis of
      proteins/peptides by Mass Spectrometry. We report Glucose Regulated Protein 78
      (GRP78) as a differentially expressed protein in the GBM cell line compared to
      human normal Astrocyte cells. In addition to proteomic studies, we performed
      microarray analysis which further confirmed up regulation of GRP78 in GBM cells
      compared to human normal Astrocyte cells. GRP78 has long been recognized as a
      molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and can be induced by the
      ER stress response. Besides its location in the ER, GRP78 has been found in cell 
      plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus and other cellular secretions. 
      GRP78 is implicated in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, immune
      escape, metastasis and angiogenesis, and its elevated expression usually
      correlates with a variety of tumor micro environmental stresses, including
      hypoxia, glucose deprivation, lactic acidosis and inflammatory response. GRP78
      protein acts as a centrally located sensor of stress, which senses and
      facilitates the adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. Our findings showed
      differential expression of this gene in brain cancer GBM and thus confirm
      similarities in findings in existing transcriptional and translational studies.
      Thus, these findings could be of further importance for diagnostic, therapeutic
      and prognostic approaches for dealing with this highly malignant cancer.

TI  - Patient-specific biomechanical modeling of ventricular enlargement in
      hydrocephalus from longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 291-8
AB  - Ogden type of hyperelastic constitutive law has recently emerged in modeling
      ventricular enlargement in hydrocephalic brain with finite element method, but
      this material property for brain tissue has not been investigated in a
      patient-specific setting in hydrocephalus. Consequently, the accuracy of the
      simulated ventricular enlargement using this hyperelastic tissue property remains
      unknown. In this study, we evaluated this brain material model in four patients
      with communicating hydrocephalus under a small trans-mantle pressure difference
      (TPMD) between brain ventricle and subarachnoid space (< 1 mmHg). Based upon
      changes in ventricular geometries obtained with sequential MRI, we found that
      this hyper-elastic model has a great flexibility and accuracy in modeling
      ventricular enlargement (with errors less than 1 mm). Our study supports the
      utility of this hyperelastic constitutive law for future hydrocephalus modeling
      and suggests that the observed ventricular enlargement in these patients may be
      caused by a slight increase in TMPD.

TI  - The adherens junction-associated protein 1 is a negative transcriptional
      regulator of MAGEA2, which potentiates temozolomide-induced apoptosis in GBM.
PG  - 1243-51
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2014.2277 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies identified the frequent loss of adherens junction-associated
      protein 1 (AJAP1) expression in glioblastoma (GBM) and its correlation with worse
      survival. AJAP1 may suppress glioma cell migration, which plays an important role
      in tumor progression in malignant gliomas such as GBM. However, the role of AJAP1
      in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and resistance to chemotherapy remains unclear.
      Based on microarray screening results, quantitative PCR and luciferase plasmid
      reporter constructs were used to evaluate the possible regulatory role of AJAP1
      on MAGEA2 expression and function. Cell death assays, TUNEL and other markers of 
      apoptosis were utilized to detect cell apoptosis. Restoration of AJAP1 expression
      in glioma cells was analyzed after temozolomide exposure. AJAP1 suppressed the
      expression of MAGEA2 and inhibited the transcriptional activity of MAGEA2 in
      glioma cells. As AJAP1 expression decreased MAGEA2 protein expression apoptosis
      increased moderately. Consistent with increased cell death, the induced loss of
      MAGEA2 expression correlated with increased caspase 3/7 activity, BCL2/BAX ratio 
      and TUNEL signal. AJAP1 expression enhanced cell death in the presence of
      temozolomide. This study suggests AJAP1 may also function as a pro-apoptotic
      factor and potentiate cell death by temozolomide in glioma cells. This effect may
      be partially explained by AJAP1-mediated gene regulation of MAGEA2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and is considered a risk factor for
      development of IPF. Retrospective studies have shown improved outcomes in
      patients given anti-acid treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      association between anti-acid treatment and disease progression in IPF. METHODS: 
      In an analysis of data from three randomised controlled trials, we identified
      patients with IPF assigned to receive placebo. Case report forms had been
      designed to prospectively obtain data about diagnosis and treatment of abnormal
      acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in each trial. The primary outcome was estimated
      change in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 30 weeks (mean follow-up) in patients
      who were and were not using a proton-pump inhibitor or histamine-receptor-2 (H2) 
      blocker. FINDINGS: Of the 242 patients randomly assigned to the placebo groups of
      the three trials, 124 (51%) were taking a proton-pump inhibitor or H2 blocker at 
      enrolment. After adjustment for sex, baseline FVC as a percentage of predicted,
      and baseline diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide as a percentage
      of predicted, patients taking anti-acid treatment at baseline had a smaller
      decrease in FVC at 30 weeks (-0.06 L, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.01) than did those not
      taking anti-acid treatment (-0.12 L, -0.17 to -0.08; difference 0.07 L, 95% CI
      0-0.14; p=0.05). INTERPRETATION: Anti-acid treatment could be beneficial in
      patients with IPF, and abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux seems to
      contribute to disease progression. Controlled clinical trials of anti-acid
      treatments are now needed. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health.

TI  - Firing behavior and network activity of single neurons in human epileptic
      hypothalamic hamartoma.
PG  - 210
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2013.00210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are intrinsically epileptogenic and
      are associated with treatment-resistant gelastic seizures. The basic cellular
      mechanisms responsible for seizure onset within HH are unknown. We used
      intra-operative microwire recordings of single neuron activity to measure the
      spontaneous firing rate of neurons and the degree of functional connection
      between neurons within the tumor. TECHNIQUE: Fourteen patients underwent
      transventricular endoscopic resection of HH for treatment-resistant epilepsy.
      Prior to surgical resection, single neuron recordings from bundled microwires
      (total of nine contacts) were obtained from HH tissue. Spontaneous activity was
      recorded for two or three 5-min epochs under steady-state general anesthesia.
      Off-line analysis included cluster analysis of single unit activity and
      probability analysis of firing relationships between pairs of neurons. RESULTS:
      Altogether, 222 neurons were identified (mean 6 neurons per recording epoch).
      Cluster analysis of single neuron firing utilizing a mixture of Gaussians model
      identified two distinct populations on the basis of firing rate (median firing
      frequency 0.6 versus 15.0 spikes per second; p < 10(-5)). Cluster analysis
      identified three populations determined by levels of burst firing (median burst
      indices of 0.015, 0.18, and 0.39; p < 10(-15)). Unbiased analysis of spontaneous 
      single unit behavior showed that 51% of all possible neuron pairs within each
      recording epoch had a significant level of firing synchrony (p < 10(-15)). The
      subgroup of neurons with higher median firing frequencies was more likely to
      demonstrate synchronous firing (p < 10(-7)). CONCLUSION: Hypothalamic hamartoma
      tissue in vivo contains neurons which fire spontaneously. The activity of single 
      neurons is diverse but distributes into at least two electrophysiological
      phenoytpes. Functional linkage between single neurons suggests that HH neurons
      exist within local networks that may contribute to ictogenesis.

TI  - Spinal cord astrocytomas: a modern 20-year experience at a single institution.
PG  - 533-40
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000190 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of 
      resection on survival and neurological outcome in a modern cohort of patients
      with spinal cord astrocytomas and identify prognostic factors for survival.
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are currently no clear treatment guidelines for
      the management of spinal cord astrocytomas. Additionally there is no conclusive
      evidence for the surgical resection of these tumors, with some studies even
      demonstrating worse survival with surgery. However, most studies have examined
      patients treated prior to the routine use of magnetic resonance imaging and
      advanced microsurgical techniques. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review
      of 46 consecutive patients with spinal cord astrocytomas treated at our
      institution from 1992 to 2012. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to 
      identify variables associated with survival. RESULTS: The majority of patients
      (67.4%) underwent surgical resection, with the remaining only receiving biopsy.
      Of those who underwent resection, only 12.5% of patients underwent gross total
      resection, all of whom had low-grade astrocytomas. Of all patients, 30.7%
      worsened compared with their preoperative baseline. The occurrence of worsening
      increased with high tumor grade (52.9% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.086) and an increased
      extent of resection (66.7% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.0069). Resection did not provide a
      survival benefit compared with biopsy alone (P = 0.53). Multivariate analysis
      revealed high-grade histology (hazard ratio, 11.3; 95% confidence interval,
      2.41-53.2; P = 0.0021), tumor dissemination (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.22-14.8; P = 0.023), and an increasing number of tumor involved
      levels (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.74; P = 0.058) to be 
      associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: As surgical intervention is
      associated with a higher rate of neurological complications and lacks a clear
      benefit, the resection of spinal cord astrocytomas should be reserved for select 
      cases and should be used sparingly.

AB  - Stem cells reside in niches that regulate the balance between self-renewal and
      differentiation. The identity of a stem cell is linked with the ability to
      interact with its niche through adhesion mechanisms. To identify targets that
      disrupt cancer stem cell (CSC) adhesion, we performed a flow cytometry screen on 
      patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) cells and identified junctional adhesion
      molecule A (JAM-A) as a CSC adhesion mechanism essential for self-renewal and
      tumor growth. JAM-A was dispensable for normal neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) 
      function, and JAM-A expression was reduced in normal brain versus GBM. Targeting 
      JAM-A compromised the self-renewal of CSCs. JAM-A expression negatively
      correlated to GBM patient prognosis. Our results demonstrate that GBM-targeting
      strategies can be identified through screening adhesion receptors and JAM-A
      represents a mechanism for niche-driven CSC maintenance.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety of mipomersen in patients with familial
      hypercholesterolaemia: 2-year interim results of an open-label extension.
PG  - 566-75
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht549 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended dosing with mipomersen in
      patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (HC) taking maximally tolerated
      lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A planned interim analysis of an
      ongoing, open-label extension trial in patients (n = 141) with familial HC
      receiving a subcutaneous injection of 200 mg mipomersen weekly plus maximally
      tolerated lipid-lowering therapy for up to 104 weeks. The mean changes in
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to weeks 26 (n = 130), 
      52 (n = 111), 76 (n = 66), and 104 (n = 53) were -28, -27, -27, and -28%; and in 
      apolipoprotein B -29, -28, -30, and -31%, respectively. Reductions in total
      cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) were
      comparable with decreases in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels. Mean high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol increased from baseline by 7 and 6% at weeks 26 and 52,
      respectively. The long-term safety profile of mipomersen was similar to that
      reported in the associated randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials. Adverse 
      events included injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. There was an
      incremental increase in the median liver fat during the initial 6-12 months that 
      appeared to diminish with continued mipomersen exposure beyond 1 year and
      returned towards baseline 24 weeks after last drug dose suggestive of adaptation.
      The median alanine aminotransferase level showed a similar trend over time.
      CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with mipomersen for up to 104 weeks provided
      sustained reductions in all atherosclerotic lipoproteins measured and a safety
      profile consistent with prior controlled trials in these high-risk patient
      populations. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT00694109.

TI  - Mutations in CSPP1 cause primary cilia abnormalities and Joubert syndrome with or
      without Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy.

AB  - Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive ciliopathy in which a subset of affected
      individuals also have the skeletal dysplasia Jeune asphyxiating thoracic
      dystrophy (JATD). Here, we have identified biallelic truncating CSPP1 (centrosome
      and spindle pole associated protein 1) mutations in 19 JBTS-affected individuals,
      four of whom also have features of JATD. CSPP1 mutations explain approximately 5%
      of JBTS in our cohort, and despite truncating mutations in all affected
      individuals, the range of phenotypic severity is broad. Morpholino knockdown of
      cspp1 in zebrafish caused phenotypes reported in other zebrafish models of JBTS
      (curved body shape, pronephric cysts, and cerebellar abnormalities) and reduced
      ciliary localization of Arl13b, further supporting loss of CSPP1 function as a
      cause of JBTS. Fibroblasts from affected individuals with CSPP1 mutations showed 
      reduced numbers of primary cilia and/or short primary cilia, as well as reduced
      axonemal localization of ciliary proteins ARL13B and adenylyl cyclase III. In
      summary, CSPP1 mutations are a major cause of the Joubert-Jeune phenotype in
      humans; however, the mechanism by which these mutations lead to both JBTS and
      JATD remains unknown.

TI  - Mutations in CSPP1, encoding a core centrosomal protein, cause a range of
      ciliopathy phenotypes in humans.

AB  - Ciliopathies are characterized by a pattern of multisystem involvement that is
      consistent with the developmental role of the primary cilium. Within this
      biological module, mutations in genes that encode components of the cilium and
      its anchoring structure, the basal body, are the major contributors to both
      disease causality and modification. However, despite rapid advances in this
      field, the majority of the genes that drive ciliopathies and the mechanisms that 
      govern the pronounced phenotypic variability of this group of disorders remain
      poorly understood. Here, we show that mutations in CSPP1, which encodes a core
      centrosomal protein, are disease causing on the basis of the independent
      identification of two homozygous truncating mutations in three consanguineous
      families (one Arab and two Hutterite) affected by variable ciliopathy phenotypes 
      ranging from Joubert syndrome to the more severe Meckel-Gruber syndrome with
      perinatal lethality and occipital encephalocele. Consistent with the recently
      described role of CSPP1 in ciliogenesis, we show that mutant fibroblasts from one
      affected individual have severely impaired ciliogenesis with concomitant defects 
      in sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Our results expand the list of centrosomal
      proteins implicated in human ciliopathies.

AB  - Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is utilized routinely in the management of
      anaplastic World Health Organization Grade III gliomas (AG), including anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO). However, the optimal role
      of RT in elderly AG patients remains controversial. We evaluated the
      effectiveness of RT in elderly AG patients using a national cancer registry. The 
      USA Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1990-2008) was used to 
      query patients over 70 years of age with AA or AO. Independent predictors of
      overall survival were determined using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
      model. Among 390 elderly patients with AG, 333 (85%) had AA and 57 (15%) had AO. 
      Approximately two-thirds of AA patients (64%) and AO patients (65%) received RT. 
      Most AO patients (58%) and many AA patients (41%) underwent surgical resection;
      the remainder had biopsy. The median overall survival for all patients who
      underwent RT was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5-7 months) versus 2
      months (95% CI 1-6) in patients who did not have RT. Patients who had gross total
      resection (GTR) plus RT had a median overall survival of 11 months (95% CI 7-14).
      Multivariate analysis for all patients showed that undergoing RT was
      significantly associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52,
      p<.0001). AA tumor type (HR 1.37, p=.03) was associated with worse survival than 
      AO tumor type; female sex (HR 0.59, p<.0001) and being married (HR 0.66, p=.002) 
      significantly improved survival. Patients that underwent GTR had a significant
      reduction in the hazards of mortality compared to biopsy (HR 0.72, p=.04).
      Elderly AG patients undergoing RT had better overall survival compared to
      patients who did not receive RT. Treatment strategies involving maximal safe
      resection plus RT should be considered in the optimal management of AG in elderly
      patients.

TI  - Fiber feature map based landmark initialization for highly deformable DTI
      registration.
LID - 10.1117/12.2006977 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel pipeline for the registration of diffusion tensor
      images (DTI) with large pathological variations to normal controls based on the
      use of a novel feature map derived from white matter (WM) fiber tracts. The
      research presented aims towards an atlas based DTI analysis of subjects with
      considerable brain pathologies such as tumors or hydrocephalus. In this paper, we
      propose a novel feature map that is robust against variations in WM fiber tract
      integrity and use these feature maps to determine a landmark correspondence using
      a 3D point correspondence algorithm. This correspondence drives a deformation
      field computed using Gaussian radial basis functions(RBF). This field is employed
      as an initialization to a standard deformable registration method like demons. We
      present early preliminary results on the registration of a normal control dataset
      to a dataset with abnormally enlarged lateral ventricles affected by fatal
      demyelinating Krabbe disease. The results are analyzed based on a regional tensor
      matching criterion and a visual assessment of overlap of major WM fiber tracts.
      While further evaluation and improvements are necessary, the results presented in
      this paper highlight the potential of our method in handling registration of
      subjects with severe WM pathology.

TI  - Selective anti-tumor activity of the novel fluoropyrimidine polymer F10 towards
      G48a orthotopic GBM tumors.
PG  - 447-54
LID - 10.1007/s11060-013-1321-1 [doi]
AB  - F10 is a novel anti-tumor agent with minimal systemic toxicity in vivo and which 
      displays strong cytotoxicity towards glioblastoma (GBM) cells in vitro. Here we
      investigate the cytotoxicity of F10 towards GBM cells and evaluate the anti-tumor
      activity of locally-administered F10 towards an orthotopic xenograft model of
      GBM. The effects of F10 on thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition and Topoisomerase
      1 (Top1) cleavage complex formation were evaluated using TS activity assays and
      in vivo complex of enzyme bioassays. Cytotoxicity of F10 towards normal brain was
      evaluated using cortices from embryonic (day 18) mice. F10 displays minimal
      penetrance of the blood-brain barrier and was delivered by intra-cerebral (i.c.) 
      administration and prospective anti-tumor response towards luciferase-expressing 
      G48a human GBM tumors in nude mice was evaluated using IVIS imaging. Histological
      examination of tumor and normal brain tissue was used to assess the selectivity
      of anti-tumor activity. F10 is cytotoxic towards G48a, SNB-19, and U-251 MG GBM
      cells through dual targeting of TS and Top1. F10 is not toxic to murine primary
      neuronal cultures. F10 is well-tolerated upon i.c. administration and induces
      significant regression of G48a tumors that is dose-dependent. Histological
      analysis from F10-treated mice revealed tumors were essentially completely
      eradicated in F10-treated mice while vehicle-treated mice displayed substantial
      infiltration into normal tissue. F10 displays strong efficacy for GBM treatment
      with minimal toxicity upon i.c. administration establishing F10 as a promising
      drug-candidate for treating GBM in human patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The frequency and successful use of pediatric ventricular assist
      devices (VADs) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation have been steadily
      increasing since 2003, but the experience in patients with complex congenital
      heart disease has not been well described. Using a large prospectively collected 
      dataset of children supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD, we have reviewed
      the experience in children with single ventricular anatomy or physiology (SV),
      and compared the results with those supported with biventricular circulation (BV)
      over the same time period. METHODS: The EXCOR Investigational Device Exemption
      study database was retrospectively reviewed. VAD implants under the primary
      cohort and compassionate use cohort between May 2007 and December 2011 were
      included in this review. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 281 patients supported with a VAD
      were SV. The most common diagnosis was hypoplastic left heart syndrome (15 of
      26). Nine patients were supported after neonatal palliative surgery
      (Blalock-Taussig shunt or Sano), 12 after a superior cavopulmonary connection
      (SCPC), and 5 after total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). Two patients received 
      biventricular assist devices, 1 after stage I surgery and 1 after stage II. SV
      patients were supported for a median time of 10.5 days (range, 1-363 days) versus
      39 days (range, 0-435 days) for BV (P = .01). The ability to be bridged to
      transplant or recovery in SV patients is lower than for BV patients (11 of 26
      [42.3%] vs 185 of 255 [72.5%]; P = .001). Three of 5 patients with TCPC were
      successfully bridged to transplant and were supported with 1 VAD. Seven of 12
      patients with SCPC were bridged to transplant, and only 1 of 9 patients supported
      after a stage I procedure survived. CONCLUSIONS: The EXCOR Pediatric VAD can
      provide a bridge to transplant for children with SV anatomy or physiology, albeit
      less successfully than in children with BV. In this small series, results are
      better in patients with SCPC and TCPC. VAD support for patients with shunted
      sources of pulmonary blood flow should be applied with caution.

TI  - Genetic susceptibility to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in mice induced by
      vanadium pentoxide (V2O5).
PG  - 1098-112
LID - 10.1096/fj.13-235044 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterized by injury, inflammation, and 
      scarring of alveoli, leading to impaired function. The etiology of idiopathic
      forms of ILD is not understood, making them particularly difficult to study due
      to the lack of appropriate animal models. Consequently, few effective therapies
      have emerged. We developed an inbred mouse model of ILD using vanadium pentoxide 
      (V2O5), the most common form of a transition metal found in cigarette smoke, fuel
      ash, mineral ores, and steel alloys. Pulmonary responses to V2O5, including
      dose-dependent increases in lung permeability, inflammation, collagen content,
      and dysfunction, were significantly greater in DBA/2J mice compared to C57BL/6J
      mice. Inflammatory and fibrotic responses persisted for 4 mo in DBA/2J mice,
      while limited responses in C57BL/6J mice resolved. We investigated the genetic
      basis for differential responses through genetic mapping of V2O5-induced lung
      collagen content in BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains and identified
      significant linkage on chromosome 4 with candidate genes that associate with
      V2O5-induced collagen content across the RI strains. Results suggest that V2O5
      may induce pulmonary fibrosis through mechanisms distinct from those in other
      models of pulmonary fibrosis. These findings should further advance our
      understanding of mechanisms involved in ILD and thereby aid in identification of 
      new therapeutic targets.

TI  - The role of cerebrospinal fluid pressure in glaucoma and other ophthalmic
      diseases: A review.
PG  - 97-106
LID - 10.1016/j.sjopt.2013.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the world. Well-known
      risk factors include age, race, a positive family history and elevated
      intraocular pressures. A newly proposed risk factor is decreased cerebrospinal
      fluid pressure (CSFP). This concept is based on the notion that a pressure
      differential exists across the lamina cribrosa, which separates the intraocular
      space from the subarachnoid fluid space. In this construct, an increased
      translaminar pressure difference will occur with a relative increase in elevated 
      intraocular pressure or a reduction in CSFP. This net change in pressure is
      proposed to act on the tissues within the optic nerve head, potentially
      contributing to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Similarly, patients with ocular
      hypertension who have elevated CSFPs, would enjoy a relatively protective effect 
      from glaucomatous damage. This review will focus on the current literature
      pertaining to the role of CSFP in glaucoma. Additionally, the authors examine the
      relationship between glaucoma and other known CSFP-related ophthalmic disorders.

TI  - Evidence that duplications of 22q11.2 protect against schizophrenia.
PG  - 37-40
LID - 10.1038/mp.2013.156 [doi]
AB  - A number of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) are deleterious for
      neurodevelopmental disorders, but large, rare, protective CNVs have not been
      reported for such phenotypes. Here we show in a CNV analysis of 47 005
      individuals, the largest CNV analysis of schizophrenia to date, that large
      duplications (1.5-3.0 Mb) at 22q11.2--the reciprocal of the well-known,
      risk-inducing deletion of this locus--are substantially less common in
      schizophrenia cases than in the general population (0.014% vs 0.085%, OR=0.17,
      P=0.00086). 22q11.2 duplications represent the first putative protective mutation
      for schizophrenia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess variation in feeding practice at hospital discharge after
      the Norwood procedure, factors associated with tube feeding, and associations
      among site, feeding mode, and growth before stage II. STUDY DESIGN: From May 2005
      to July 2008, 555 subjects from 15 centers were enrolled in the Pediatric Heart
      Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial; 432 survivors with feeding data at
      hospital discharge after the Norwood procedure were analyzed. RESULTS:
      Demographic and clinical variables were compared among 4 feeding modes: oral only
      (n = 140), oral/tube (n = 195), nasogastric tube (N-tube) only (n = 40), and
      gastrostomy tube (G-tube) only (n = 57). There was significant variation in
      feeding mode among sites (oral only 0%-81% and G-tube only 0%-56%, P < .01).
      After adjusting for site, multivariable modeling showed G-tube feeding at
      discharge was associated with longer hospitalization, and N-tube feeding was
      associated with greater number of discharge medications (R(2) = 0.65, P < .01).
      After adjusting for site, mean pre-stage II weight-for-age z-score was
      significantly higher in the oral-only group (-1.4) vs the N-tube-only (-2.2) and 
      G-tube-only (-2.1) groups (P = .04 and .02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Feeding
      mode at hospital discharge after the Norwood procedure varied among sites.
      Prolonged hospitalization and greater number of medications at the time of
      discharge were associated with tube feeding. Infants exclusively fed orally had a
      higher weight-for-age z score pre-stage II than those fed exclusively by tube.
      Exploring strategies to prevent morbidities and promote oral feeding in this
      highest risk population is warranted.

TI  - PTEN status mediates 2ME2 anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical glioblastoma models:
      role of HIF1alpha suppression.
PG  - 89-97
LID - 10.1007/s11060-013-1283-3 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common brain cancer and is highly lethal in both
      adults and children. 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a microtubule inhibitor that
      potently inhibits HIF1alpha, GBM angiogenesis and tumor growth in preclinical
      models. In patients, 2ME2 exhibits low toxicity and promising but inconsistent
      efficacy. Given its preclinical potency and its tolerability in patients, we
      sought to determine whether 2ME2 therapy could be enhanced by addressing
      resistance via combination therapy, and with biomarkers to identify responsive
      glioma subgroups. We demonstrate that the PTEN-PI3K axis regulates HIF1alpha in
      glioma models. We utilized isogenic-pairs of glioma cell lines, deficient in PTEN
      or stably reconstituted with PTEN, to determine the role of PTEN in 2ME2
      sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Chou-Talalay synergy studies reveal significant
      synergy when a pan-PI3K inhibitor is combined with 2ME2. This synergistic
      activity was correlated with a synergistic suppression of HIF1alpha accumulation 
      under hypoxic conditions in glioma models. In vivo, 2ME2 markedly inhibited
      tumor-induced angiogenesis and significantly reduced tumor growth only in a PTEN 
      reconstituted GBM models in both subcutaneous and orthotopic intracranial mouse
      models. Collectively, these results: (1) suggest that PTEN status predicts
      sensitivity to 2ME2 and (2) justify exploration of 2ME2 combined with pan-PI3K
      inhibitors for the treatment of this intractable brain cancer.

TI  - Potential of handheld optical coherence tomography to determine cause of
      infantile nystagmus in children by using foveal morphology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of handheld (HH) ultra-high-resolution 
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in young children with
      nystagmus, to determine its sensitivity and specificity in classifying foveal
      abnormalities, and to investigate its potential to determine the cause of
      infantile nystagmus with the use of foveal morphology. DESIGN: Prospective,
      case-control study. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: A total of 50 patients with
      nystagmus and 50 healthy control subjects (mean age, 3.2 years; range, 0-8
      years). METHODS: Each patient was scanned using HH SD-OCT (Bioptigen Inc.,
      Research Triangle Park, NC) without sedation, and foveal morphology was
      classified into 1 of 4 categories: (1) typical foveal hypoplasia (predicting
      clinical diagnosis of albinism, PAX6 mutations, or isolated foveal hypoplasia);
      (2) atypical foveal hypoplasia (predicting achromatopsia); (3) other foveal
      changes (corresponding to retinal dystrophies); and (4) normal fovea (predicting 
      idiopathic or manifest latent nystagmus). An independent interpretation of the HH
      SD-OCT scans by masked examiners was performed, and the sensitivity and
      specificity of the predicted diagnosis were calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      The success rate of image acquisition and sensitivity and specificity of the HH
      SD-OCT in classifying foveal abnormalities. RESULTS: In 94% of examinations, HH
      SD-OCT was successful. Twenty-three patients had typical foveal hypoplasia
      (category 1). Of these patients, 21 were diagnosed with albinism and 2 were
      diagnosed with PAX6 mutations. Five patients were classified as atypical
      (category 2) and diagnosed with achromatopsia. Six patients had other abnormal
      foveal morphology (category 3) and were diagnosed with retinal dystrophy. Sixteen
      patients had normal foveal morphology (category 4). Of these patients, 12 were
      diagnosed with idiopathic nystagmus and 4 were diagnosed with manifest latent
      nystagmus. Sensitivities of HH SD-OCT for classifying typical or atypical foveal 
      hypoplasia, other abnormal foveal morphology, and normal morphology were 92.8%,
      86.7%, 41.1%, and 88.4%, respectively, with specificities of 91.4%, 94.8%, 97.7% 
      and 95.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate excellent feasibility of HH 
      SD-OCT in the diagnosis of conditions associated with infantile nystagmus. The HH
      SD-OCT classification of foveal abnormalities was highly sensitive and specific. 
      This classification was used to determine the underlying cause of infantile
      nystagmus. Handheld SD-OCT in early childhood can facilitate focused
      investigations and earlier diagnosis. This is important in an era when
      potentially time-sensitive treatment, such as gene therapy, is imminent.

TI  - Levomilnacipran ER 40 mg and 80 mg in patients with major depressive disorder: a 
      phase III, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 40-9
LID - 10.1503/jpn.130040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global health concern. This
      study examined the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an extended-release (ER) 
      formulation of levomilnacipran, an antidepressant approved for the treatment of
      MDD in adults. METHODS: This 10-week (1-week placebo run-in period, 8-week
      double-blind treatment, 1-week down-taper), multicentre, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted between June
      2011 and March 2012. Adult outpatients (age 18-75 yr) with MDD were randomly
      assigned (1:1:1) to placebo or to levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day or 80 mg/day. For 
      primary efficacy, we analyzed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
      (MADRS) change from baseline to week 8 using a mixed-effects model for
      repeated-measures approach on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. For secondary
      efficacy, we used the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and for safety, we examined
      adverse events and laboratory, vital sign/physical and electrocardiography
      findings. RESULTS: The ITT population consisted of 185 patients in the placebo
      group, 185 in the levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day group and 187 in the
      levomilnacipran ER 80 mg/day group. Study completion rates were similar among the
      groups (76%-83%). On MADRS change from baseline the least squares mean difference
      (LSMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) versus placebo was significant for
      levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day (-3.3 [-5.5 to -1.1], p = 0.003) and 80 mg/day
      (-3.1, [-5.3 to -1.0], p = 0.004). On SDS change from baseline the LSMD (and 95% 
      CI) versus placebo was also significant for levomilnacipran ER 40 mg/day (-1.8,
      95% [-3.6 to 0], p = 0.046) and 80 mg/day (-2.7 [-4.5 to -0.9], p = 0.003). More 
      patients in the levomilnacipran ER than the placebo group prematurely exited the 
      study owing to adverse events; common adverse events (>/= 5% and >/= double the
      rate of placebo) were nausea, dry mouth, increased heart rate, constipation,
      dizziness, hyperhidrosis, urinary hesitation and erectile dysfunction.
      LIMITATIONS: Limitations to our study included short treatment duration and lack 
      of an active control arm. CONCLUSION: Levomilnacipran ER at doses of 40 mg/day
      and 80 mg/day demonstrated efficacy on symptomatic and functional measures of MDD
      and was generally well tolerated in this patient population. CLINICAL TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: NCT01377194.

TI  - The genetic landscape of anaplastic astrocytoma.
PG  - 1452-7
AB  - Anaplastic astrocytoma WHO grade III (A3) is a lethal brain tumor that often
      occurs in middle aged patients. Clinically, it is challenging to distinguish A3
      from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) WHO grade IV. To reveal the genetic landscape 
      of this tumor type, we sequenced the exome of a cohort of A3s (n=16). For
      comparison and to illuminate the genomic landscape of other glioma subtypes, we
      also included in our study diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade II (A2, n=7),
      oligoastrocytoma WHO grade II (OA2, n=2), anaplastic oligoastrocytoma WHO grade
      III (OA3, n=4), and GBM (n=28). Exome sequencing of A3s identified frequent
      mutations in IDH1 (75%, 12/16), ATRX (63%, 10/16), and TP53 (82%, 13/16). In
      contrast, the majority of GBMs (75%, 21/28) did not contain IDH1 or ATRX
      mutations, and displayed a distinct spectrum of mutations. Finally, our study
      also identified novel genes that were not previously linked to this tumor type.
      In particular, we found mutations in Notch pathway genes (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH4,
      NOTCH2NL), including a recurrent NOTCH1-A465Tmutation, in 31% (5/16) of A3s. This
      study suggests genetic signatures will be useful for the classification of
      gliomas.

TI  - Clinical comparison of the TonoVet((R)) rebound tonometer and the Tono-Pen
      Vet((R)) applanation tonometer in dogs and cats with ocular disease: glaucoma or 
      corneal pathology.
PG  - 20-7
LID - 10.1111/vop.12101 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the TonoVet((R)) rebound tonometer with the Tono-Pen
      Vet((R)) applanation tonometer in a larger number of glaucomatous eyes and to
      evaluate the effect of different corneal pathologies on both tonometers.
      PROCEDURE: In 26 eyes with clinical signs of glaucoma, intraocular pressure (IOP)
      was measured using the TonoVet((R)) followed by the Tono-Pen Vet((R)) . In 29
      eyes with focal corneal pathology (e.g., corneal scarring, edema, pigmentation), 
      both tonometers were used successively to measure IOP in one unaffected area of
      the cornea, as well as on the lesion itself. Impact on measurement results was
      assessed comparing the deviation in IOP readings of each tonometer between the
      two localizations. Statistical data analysis included paired t-tests and
      regression analysis using sas software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
      RESULTS: In glaucomatous eyes, the TonoVet((R)) consistently yielded higher
      values of IOP than the Tono-Pen Vet((R)) as can be quantified by the regression
      equation IOP (TonoVet((R)) ) [mmHg] = 1.12 * IOP (Tono-Pen Vet((R)) ) [mmHg] +
      11.5 with R(2) = 0.91 and P < 0.0001. Depending on the type and degree of corneal
      pathology, the deviation in IOP resulting from measurements on altered cornea
      ranged from -6 to 16 mmHg for the TonoVet((R)) and -7 to 20 mmHg for the Tono-Pen
      Vet((R)) , respectively. On average, the effect of corneal disease on IOP
      measurements was lower for the TonoVet((R)) by 1.14 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: Rebound
      tonometry appears to be a valuable alternative to established applanation
      tonometry in patients with ocular disease such as glaucoma and corneal disorders.
      In patients suffering from glaucoma, the same type of tonometer should be used
      for follow-up examinations, as measurement results of the TonoVet((R)) and the
      Tono-Pen Vet((R)) differ substantially with increasing IOP. Corneal pathology has
      considerable influence on both tonometers with the degree of over- or
      underestimation of IOP depending on the alteration of biomechanical properties of
      the cornea inflicted by various corneal pathologies.

AB  - We investigated truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (TGLI1) that
      behaves as gain-of-function GLI1 and promotes tumor cell migration and invasion. 
      Herein, we report that TGLI1 had a higher propensity than GLI1 to enhance
      glioblastoma angiogenesis and growth, both in vivo and in vitro. TGLI1 has gained
      the ability to enhance expression of pro-angiogenic heparanase. In patient
      glioblastomas, TGLI1 levels are correlated with heparanase expression. Together, 
      we report that TGLI1 is a novel mediator of glioblastoma angiogenesis and that
      heparanase is a novel transcriptional target of TGLI1, shedding new light on the 
      molecular pathways that support tumor angiogenesis and aggressive growth.

TI  - An automated system for detecting nonadherence in laboratory testing and
      monitoring for myelosuppression in patients receiving self-administered oral
      chemotherapy.
PG  - e268-71

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient compliance with routine monitoring for self-administered
      chemotherapy is problematic. We sought to assess monitoring lapses and incidents 
      of myelosuppression in patients undergoing self-administered chemotherapy for
      glioblastoma, as well as test software designed to detect and alert clinicians to
      lapses in monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was
      conducted to identify patients (N=117) who received standard oral temozolomide
      for glioblastoma at our institution from 2003 to 2010. Gaps in monitoring were
      classified as minor (10 to 12 days) or major (13 to 28 days), and adverse events 
      were graded using standard criteria. During the prospective portion of the study,
      we tested a software-based system that alerted clinicians of monitoring lapses
      and adverse events among patients receiving self-administered temozolomide for
      glioblastoma (n=37). RESULTS: Our retrospective review found that 34 of 117
      patients experienced monitoring gaps during treatment. No association between
      gaps and risk of myelosuppression were found. Patients with gaps were more likely
      to be male (P=.04). Patients monitored prospectively with the software
      experienced no major gaps in monitoring (P=.007 compared with retrospective
      patients). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective review demonstrated that monitoring
      nonadherence was occurring at a substantial rate. Our computerized system
      eliminated major gaps in monitoring in the prospective portion of our study.
      Although there is no association between monitoring gaps and the occurrence of
      adverse events, when they do coincide, continuing oral chemotherapy during an
      unrecognized adverse event may worsen the patient's condition. Automated systems 
      are justified and serve a function not currently being addressed.

TI  - An EGFRvIII-targeted bispecific T-cell engager overcomes limitations of the
      standard of care for glioblastoma.

LID - 10.1586/17512433.2013.811806 [doi]
AB  - While advanced surgical techniques, radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic
      regimens provide a tangible benefit for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the
      average survival from the time of diagnosis remains less than 15 months. Current 
      therapy for GBM is limited by the nonspecific nature of treatment, prohibiting
      therapy that is aggressive and prolonged enough to eliminate all malignant cells.
      As an alternative, bispecific antibodies can redirect the immune system to
      eliminate malignant cells with exquisite potency and specificity. We have
      recently developed an EGF receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)-targeted bispecific
      antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate EGFRvIII-expressing GBM. The
      absolute tumor specificity of EGFRvIII and the lack of immunologic
      crossreactivity with healthy cells allow this therapeutic to overcome limitations
      associated with the nonspecific nature of the current standard of care for GBM.
      Evidence indicates that the molecule can exert therapeutically significant
      effects in the CNS following systemic administration. Additional advantages in
      terms of ease-of-production and off-the-shelf availability further the clinical
      utility of this class of therapeutics.

TI  - Deletion of TOP3beta, a component of FMRP-containing mRNPs, contributes to
      neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG  - 1228-1237
LID - 10.1038/nn.3484 [doi]
AB  - Implicating particular genes in the generation of complex brain and behavior
      phenotypes requires multiple lines of evidence. The rarity of most high-impact
      genetic variants typically precludes the possibility of accruing statistical
      evidence that they are associated with a given trait. We found that the
      enrichment of a rare chromosome 22q11.22 deletion in a recently expanded Northern
      Finnish sub-isolate enabled the detection of association between TOP3B and both
      schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. Biochemical analysis of TOP3beta revealed
      that this topoisomerase was a component of cytosolic messenger ribonucleoproteins
      (mRNPs) and was catalytically active on RNA. The recruitment of TOP3beta to mRNPs
      was independent of RNA cis-elements and was coupled to the co-recruitment of
      FMRP, the disease gene product in fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Our
      results indicate a previously unknown role for TOP3beta in mRNA metabolism and
      suggest that it is involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.

      complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage: a retrospective analysis.
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1186/2193-1801-2-314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% Sodium Chloride (Voluven(R);
      6% HES 130/0.4) is a colloid often used for fluid resuscitation in patients with 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite a lack of safety data for this use. The
      purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of 6% HES 130/0.4 on major
      complications associated with SAH. METHODS: Medical records of all patients
      presenting between May 2010 and September 2012 with aneurysmal SAH were analyzed.
      Patients were divided in two groups based on the administration of 6% HES
      130/0.4; HES group (n=57) and Non-HES group (n=72). The primary outcome included 
      a composite of three major complications associated with SAH: Delayed Cerebral
      Ischemia (DCI), Hydrocephalus (HCP) requiring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting,
      and Rebleeding. RESULTS: The study groups were similar with respect to most
      characteristics except the incidences of hypertension, ischemic heart disease,
      Fisher grade and lowest hemoglobin during stay. The odds of developing the
      primary composite outcome was higher in the HES group [OR= 3.1(1.30-7.36),
      p=0.01]. The patients in the HES group had a significantly longer median duration
      of hospital (19 vs 14 days) and Neurointensive Care Unit stay (14 vs 10 days)
      compared to the Non HES group. CONCLUSION: We observed increased complications
      after SAH with 6% HES 130/0.4 (Voluven(R)) administration. An adequately powered 
      prospective randomized controlled trial into the safety of 6% HES 130/0.4 in this
      patient population is warranted.

      Disease-Related Pigmentation Defects in hESCs and Patient-Specific iPSCS. Cell
      Reports 3, 1140-1152. Epidermal melanocytes are pigment-producing cells derived
      from the neural crest (NC), a transient embryonic stem cell population that
      emerges from the dorsal margin of the neural plate in vertebrate embryos. The
      generation of melanocytes encompasses several intricate cellular processes
      including fate specification, proliferation, migration, and differentiation.
      Aberrant melanocyte development and homeostasis is at the onset of many
      pigmentary disorders, such as albinism, piebaldism, vitiligo, hyperplasia, and
      melanoma. Therefore, understanding human melanocytic development and disease is
      crucial. To this end, the establishment of methods that facilitate the study of
      patient-specific melanocyte biology and disease modeling is important. This

      review.
PG  - 733-7
LID - 10.1089/lap.2013.0076 [doi]
AB  - Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy tube placement have grown in
      popularity within the pediatric population for treatment of gastroesophageal
      reflux disease and failure to thrive, respectively. One population that has an
      increased need for gastric surgery in infancy is patients with congenital heart
      defects, especially those with "single ventricle physiology." The most common
      defect included in this population is hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).
      Because of the abnormal physiology present in this condition, there are concerns 
      with regard to the use of laparoscopic procedures for gastric surgery in patients
      treated with a three-staged reconstruction. We review the staged reconstruction
      of infants with HLHS, address safety concerns of interstage noncardiac procedures
      on this patient population, and review the current literature regarding outcomes 
      of laparoscopic gastric surgery on patients with single ventricle physiology.

AB  - Herein, a green method for the development of a novel biodegradable silver
      nanoparticles (NPs) impregnated alginate-chitosan-blended nanocarrier (Ag
      NPs-Alg-Chi NC) is reported. The synthesis of Ag NPs-Alg-Chi NC is based on the
      polyelectrolyte complex formation between alginate and chitosan. The composite NC
      is characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron
      microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The Ag NPs in the NC are found to elicit
      anticell proliferative effect on refractory U87MG (human glioblastoma) cells at
      IC50 of 2.4 mug mL(-1) for Ag NPs. The cell cycle analysis shows extensive DNA
      damage. Elevation in reactive oxygen species level indicates induction of
      oxidative stress in treated cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction in cell death is
      evident from the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ).
      Fluorescence and SEM images of the treated cells reveal nuclear and morphological
      changes characteristic of apoptosis, which is further confirmed by TUNEL assay.
      The induction of apoptosis at low concentration of Ag NPs present in Ag
      NPs-Alg-Chi NC in comparison with free Ag NPs makes it a promising tool for
      cancer therapy.

AB  - Adult brainstem gliomas (BSG) are uncommon tumors that constitute only 2% of all 
      brain tumors. Due to its rare occurrence in the elderly (60 years and older),
      there is no literature discussing the natural history, prognosis, and best
      treatment strategy for malignant BSG in this population to our knowledge. We
      report seven elderly patients with malignant BSG and propose treatment strategies
      to manage these aggressive tumors. The median age at onset in this cohort was 65 
      years, with the majority of patients being male (71.4%) and Caucasian (85.7%).
      The median duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 0.5 months, with the
      most common symptoms being facial weakness, blurry vision, headache, and
      extremity weakness. Tumors were most commonly located in the pons (85.7%), with
      one tumor being located in the tectal plate. Five of seven (71.4%) patients
      underwent biopsies, with two patients undergoing partial resections. Following
      tissue diagnosis, patients received radiation therapy and concurrent
      temozolomide, followed by additional chemotherapeutics upon progression. Side
      effects as a result of treatment were seen in three patients and all involved
      reversible hematological complications such as neutropenia and thrombopenia. The 
      median time to progression was 6.7 months and the median overall survival was
      13.5 months. While malignant BSG in elderly patients are aggressive gliomas with 
      an overall poor prognosis, these patients are able to safely undergo aggressive
      chemoradiotherapy, resulting in improved survival. Resection may be considered
      for select patients in which the tumor is mostly exophytic, near the brainstem
      surface, and easily accessible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss is common in advanced
      prostate cancer, leading to constitutive activation of the PI3 kinase pathway.
      Temsirolimus blocks mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/target of rapamycin
      complex 1 (TORC1), a key signaling node in this pathway; its activity in men with
      advanced castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC) is unknown.
      METHODS: We conducted a single-arm trial of weekly intravenous temsirolimus
      administration in men with chemorefractory mCRPC who had >/= 5 circulating tumor 
      cells (CTCs) at baseline. The primary end point was the change in CTCs at 8
      weeks; secondary end points were composite progression-free survival (PFS)
      (excluding prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), PSA and radiographic response rates,
      safety, and survival. At PSA/CTC progression, an anti-androgen could be added
      while continuing temsirolimus. RESULTS: Eleven patients were accrued out of a
      planned 20; the trial was stopped prematurely because of lack of
      efficacy/feasibility. Median age was 61 years, with 55% African-Americans and 36%
      Caucasian patients. Median baseline PSA level was 390 ng/dL, median baseline
      number of CTCs was 14 cells; 50% of patients had pain, and 63% had undergone >/= 
      2 previous chemotherapy regimens. Median CTC decline was 48% and 3 patients
      experienced decline in CTCs to < 5. However, 73% of men had a persistently
      unfavorable number of CTCs (>/= 5) and only 1 patient had a >/= 30% PSA decline. 
      Median PFS was 1.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-3.1) and median
      overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months (95% CI, 3.1-15.6). Toxicities included
      grade 4 hypophosphatemia and central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, and
      frequent grade 3 fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, hypokalemia, weakness, and
      hyperglycemia. CONCLUSION: Temsirolimus lacked sufficient clinical activity in
      men with mCRPC, despite transient CTC improvements in some men. Future studies
      should focus on combination approaches or novel PI3K pathway inhibitors.

      surgery.
PG  - 593-600
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31828aa5ee [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine sildenafil exposure and hemodynamic effect in children
      after stage II single-ventricle surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, dose escalation
      trial. SETTING: Single-center, pediatric catheterization laboratory. PATIENTS:
      Twelve children poststage II single-ventricle surgical palliation and undergoing 
      elective cardiac catheterization: median age 1.9 years (range, 0.8, 4.0), weight 
      11 kg (8, 13), nine females, and 10 with a single right ventricle. INTERVENTIONS:
      Catheterization and echocardiography performed before and immediately after
      single-dose IV sildenafil (0.125, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.45 mg/kg over 20 min).
      MEASUREMENTS: Peak sildenafil and desmethyl sildenafil concentration, change in
      hemodynamic parameters measured by cardiac catheterization and echocardiography
      including indexed pulmonary vascular resistance, and myocardial performance. MAIN
      RESULTS: Maximum sildenafil concentrations ranged from 92 to 775 ng/mL and were
      above the in vitro threshold needed for 77% phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5)
      inhibition in 80% of subjects and 90% inhibition in 80% of subjects with doses
      >/=0.35 mg/kg. Sildenafil lowered pulmonary vascular resistance index in all 12
      subjects (median pulmonary vascular resistance index 2.2 [range, 1.6, 7.9];
      decreased to 1.7 [1.2, 5.4] WU x m; p < 0.01) with no dose-response effect.
      Sildenafil improved pulmonary blood flow (+8% [0, 20], p = 0.04) and saturations 
      (+2% [0, 16], p = 0.04) in those with baseline pulmonary vascular resistance
      index >/= 2 WU x m (n = 7). Change in saturations correlated inversely with
      change in pulmonary vascular resistance index (r = 0.74, p < 0.01). Sildenafil
      also lowered mean blood pressure (-12% [-20, +10]; p = 0.04). There was no change
      in cardiac index and no effect on myocardial performance. There were no adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil demonstrated nonlinear exposure with high
      interindividual variability but was well tolerated and effectively lowered
      pulmonary vascular resistance index in all subjects. Sildenafil did not acutely
      improve myocardial performance or increase cardiac index.

TI  - Cooperativity between MAPK and PI3K signaling activation is required for
      glioblastoma pathogenesis.
PG  - 1317-29
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/not084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) genomes feature recurrent genetic alterations that
      dysregulate core intracellular signaling pathways, including the G1/S cell cycle 
      checkpoint and the MAPK and PI3K effector arms of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
      signaling. Elucidation of the phenotypic consequences of activated RTK effectors 
      is required for the design of effective therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.
      METHODS: Genetically defined, G1/S checkpoint-defective cortical murine
      astrocytes with constitutively active Kras and/or Pten deletion mutations were
      used to systematically investigate the individual and combined roles of these 2
      RTK signaling effectors in phenotypic hallmarks of glioblastoma pathogenesis,
      including growth, migration, and invasion in vitro. A novel syngeneic orthotopic 
      allograft model system was used to examine in vivo tumorigenesis. RESULTS:
      Constitutively active Kras and/or Pten deletion mutations activated both MAPK and
      PI3K signaling. Their combination led to maximal growth, migration, and invasion 
      of G1/S-defective astrocytes in vitro and produced progenitor-like transcriptomal
      profiles that mimic human proneural GBM. Activation of both RTK effector arms was
      required for in vivo tumorigenesis and produced highly invasive, proneural-like
      GBM. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cortical astrocytes can be
      transformed into GBM and that combined dysregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling
      revert G1/S-defective astrocytes to a primitive gene expression state. This
      genetically-defined, immunocompetent model of proneural GBM will be useful for
      preclinical development of MAPK/PI3K-targeted, subtype-specific therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myelomeningocele (MMC) commonly causes impairments in body structure 
      and functions as well as cognitive disabilities that can have an adverse effect
      on adult life. Improved medical care has resulted in increased numbers of
      individuals with MMC surviving to adulthood, however little is known about the
      impact of MMC on the lives of adults age 25 years or older. OBJECTIVE: To gain a 
      better understanding of outcomes in education, employment, relationships,
      reproduction and life satisfaction of adults with MMC. METHODS: A primarily
      quantitative multiple-choice questionnaire designed to capture outcomes in
      education, employment, relationships and reproduction, along with a previously
      validated life satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11), was completed by adults with
      MMC. Relationships between demographic variables, outcomes and life satisfaction 
      were determined using cross tabulation analysis, logistic regression and linear
      regression. RESULTS: Ninety adults with MMC, age 25-85 years (median age 32),
      reported a diverse range of outcomes in education, employment, relationships and 
      reproduction. The most consistent variable associated with difficulty attaining
      adult milestones was hydrocephalus, the presence of which reduced the likelihood 
      of living independently (p </= 0.001), having a partner (p = 0.003) and
      reproducing (p </= 0.001), but did not contribute to reduced life satisfaction.
      CONCLUSIONS: Adults with MMC, especially those without hydrocephalus, can obtain 
      gainful employment, live independently, form partner relationships and have
      children, and these achievements contribute to life satisfaction. While MMC does 
      not affect overall reported life satisfaction for adults, attention should be
      paid to specific domains with less reported satisfaction.

AB  - Children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are significantly
      impaired in their academic performance and functionality due to cognitive
      deficits, especially in attention, memory, and other facets of executive
      function. Compounding these cognitive deficits is the remarkably high risk of
      major psychoses, occurring in 25% of adolescents and adults with the disorder.
      There are currently no evidence-based interventions designed to improve the
      cognitive deficits in these individuals. We implemented a neuroplasticity-based
      computerized cognitive remediation program for 12 weeks in 13 adolescents with
      22q11DS, assessed feasibility, and measured changes in cognition before and after
      the intervention compared to a control group of 10 age- and gender-matched
      children with 22q11DS. Our results indicated that despite their cognitive
      impairments, this intervention is feasible in children with 22q11DS, with high
      rates of adherence and satisfaction. Our preliminary analyses indicate that gains
      in cognition occur with the intervention. Further study in a larger randomized
      controlled trial would enable assessment of efficacy of this novel intervention.

PG  - 31-47

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at risk for
      social-behavioural and neurocognitive sequelae throughout development. The
      current study examined the impact of family environmental characteristics on
      social-behavioural and cognitive outcomes in this paediatric population. METHOD: 
      Guardians of children with 22q11DS were recruited through two medical genetics
      clinics. Consenting guardians were asked to complete several questionnaires
      regarding their child's social, emotional and behavioural functioning, as well as
      family social environment and parenting styles. Children with 22q11DS were asked 
      to undergo a cognitive assessment, including IQ and achievement testing, and
      measures of attention, executive function and memory. RESULTS: Modest
      associations were found between aspects of the family social environment and
      parenting styles with social-behavioural and cognitive/academic outcomes.
      Regression models indicated that physical punishment, socioeconomic status,
      parental control and family organisation significantly predicted
      social-behavioural and cognitive outcomes in children with 22q11DS. CONCLUSION:
      Characteristics of the family social environment and parenting approaches appear 
      to be associated with functional outcomes of children with 22q11DS. Understanding
      the impact of environmental variables on developmental outcomes can be useful in 
      determining more effective targets for intervention. This will be important in
      order to improve the quality of life of individuals affected by 22q11DS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease
      with pulmonary vasculopathy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to
      determine whether sildenafil improves 6-min walk distance (6MWD) in subjects with
      IPF and right ventricular dysfunction. METHODS: The IPFnet, a network of IPF
      research centers in the United States, conducted a randomized trial examining the
      effect of sildenafil on 6MWD in patients with advanced IPF, defined by carbon
      monoxide diffusing capacity &lt; 35% predicted. A substudy examined 119 of 180
      randomized subjects where echocardiograms were available for independent review
      by two cardiologists. Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy (RVH), right ventricular
      systolic dysfunction (RVSD), and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) were 
      assessed. Multivariable linear regression models estimated the relationship
      between RV abnormality, sildenafil treatment, and changes in 6MWD, St. George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the EuroQol instrument, and SF-36 Health Survey
      (SF-36) from enrollment to 12 weeks. RESULTS: The prevalence of RVH and RVSD were
      12.8% and 18.6%, respectively. RVSP was measurable in 71 of 119 (60%) subjects;
      mean RVSP was 42.5 mm Hg. In the subgroup of subjects with RVSD, subjects treated
      with sildenafil experienced less decrement in 6MWD (99.3 m; P = .01) and greater 
      improvement in SGRQ (13.4 points; P = .005) and EuroQol visual analog scores
      (17.9 points; P = .04) than subjects receiving placebo. In the subgroup with RVH,
      sildenafil was not associated with change in 6MWD (P = .13), but was associated
      with greater relative improvement in SGRQ (14.8 points; P = .02) vs subjects
      receiving placebo. Sildenafil treatment in those with RVSD and RVH was not
      associated with change in SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil treatment in IPF with
      RVSD results in better preservation of exercise capacity as compared with
      placebo. Sildenafil also improves quality of life in subjects with RVH and RVSD.

AB  - Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) occurs rarely in adults, accounting for 
      0.4-3.4% of all GBM. Current studies have all involved small patient numbers,
      limiting the clear identification of prognostic factors. Additionally, while few 
      studies have compared cerebellar GBM to their supratentorial counterparts, there 
      is conflicting data regarding their relative prognosis. To better characterize
      outcome and identify patient and treatment factors which affect survival, the
      authors analyzed cases of adult cerebellar GBM from the Surveillance,
      Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 247 adult patients with
      cerebellar GBM were identified, accounting for 0.67% of all adult GBM. Patients
      with cerebellar GBM were significantly younger than those with supratentorial
      tumors (56.6 versus 61.8 years, p < 0.0001), but a larger percentage of patients 
      with supratentorial GBM were Caucasian (91.7% versus 85.0%, p < 0.0001). Overall 
      median survival did not differ between those with cerebellar and supratentorial
      GBM (7 versus 8 months, p = 0.24), with similar rates of long-term (greater than 
      2 years) survival (13.4% versus 10.6%, p = 0.21). Multivariate analysis revealed 
      age greater than 40 years (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
      1.47-3.28; p = 0.0001) to be associated with worse patient survival, while the
      use of radiotherapy (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.24-0.47; p < 0.0001) and surgical
      resection (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45-0.96; p = 0.028) were seen to be independent
      favorable prognostic factors. In conclusion, patients with cerebellar GBM have an
      overall poor prognosis, with radiotherapy and surgical resection significantly
      improving survival. As with supratentorial GBM, older age is a poor prognostic
      factor. The lack of differences between supratentorial and cerebellar GBM with
      respect to overall survival and prognostic factors suggests these tumors to be
      biologically similar.

TI  - Low-grade astrocytomas: the prognostic value of fibrillary, gemistocytic, and
      protoplasmic tumor histology.
PG  - 434-41
LID - 10.3171/2013.4.JNS122329 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas that over
      time may progress into more malignant tumors. Various factors have been shown to 
      affect the time to progression and overall survival including age, performance
      status, tumor size, and the extent of resection. However, more recently it has
      been suggested that histological subtypes (fibrillary, protoplasmic, and
      gemistocytic) may impact patient outcome. In this study the authors have
      performed a large comparative population-based analysis to examine the
      characteristics and survival of patients with the various subtypes of WHO Grade
      II astrocytomas. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with fibrillary, protoplasmic, and
      gemistocytic astrocytomas were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
      and End Results (SEER) database. The chi-square test and Student t-test were used
      to evaluate differences in patient and treatment characteristics between
      astrocytoma subtypes. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess overall survival, 
      and the log-rank test was used to evaluate the differences between survival
      curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to determine the
      effect of various patient, tumor, and treatment variables on overall survival.
      RESULTS: A total of 500 cases were included in the analysis, consisting of 326
      fibrillary (65.2%), 29 protoplasmic (5.8%), and 145 gemistocytic (29%) variants. 
      Gemistocytic astrocytomas presented at a significantly older age than the
      fibrillary variant (46.8 vs 37.7 years, p < 0.0001), with protoplasmic and
      fibrillary subtypes having a similar age. Although protoplasmic and fibrillary
      variants underwent radiotherapy at similar rates, gemistocytic tumors more
      frequently received radiotherapy (p = 0.0001). Univariate analysis revealed older
      age, larger tumor size, and the use of radiotherapy to be poor prognostic
      factors, with resection being associated with improved survival. The gemistocytic
      subtype (hazard ratio [HR] 1.62 [95% CI 1.27-2.07], p = 0.0001) also resulted in 
      significantly worse survival than fibrillary tumors. Bivariate analyses
      demonstrated that older age, the use of radiotherapy, and resection significantly
      influenced median survival. Tumor subtype also affected median survival; patients
      who harbored gemistocytic tumors experienced less than half the median survival
      of fibrillary and protoplasmic tumors (38 vs 82 months, p = 0.0003). Multivariate
      analysis revealed increasing age (HR 1.05 [95% CI 1.04-1.05], p < 0.0001), larger
      tumor size (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.03], p = 0.0002), and the use of resection (HR
      0.70 [95% CI 0.52-0.94], p = 0.018) to be independent predictors of survival.
      Examination of tumor subtype revealed that the gemistocytic variant (HR 1.30 [95%
      CI 0.98-1.74], p = 0.074) was associated with worse patient survival than
      fibrillary tumors, although this only approached significance. The protoplasmic
      subtype did not affect overall survival (p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Gemistocytic
      tumor histology was associated with worse survival than fibrillary and
      protoplasmic astrocytomas. As protoplasmic astrocytomas have a survival similar
      to fibrillary tumors, there may be limited utility to the identification of this 
      rare variant. However, increased attention should be paid to the presence of
      gemistocytes in low-grade gliomas as this is associated with shorter time to
      progression, increased malignant transformation, and reduced overall survival.

PG  - 1825-9
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.000749 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute cocaine use has been temporally associated with
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This study analyzes the impact of
      cocaine use on patient presentation, complications, and outcomes. METHODS: Data
      of patients admitted with aSAH between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed to determine
      impact of acute cocaine use (C). These patients were compared with aSAH patients 
      without recent cocaine exposure (NC) in relation to their presentation,
      complications such as aneurysmal rerupture and delayed cerebral ischemia, and
      outcomes including hospital mortality and functional outcome. RESULTS: Data of
      1134 aSAH patients were reviewed; 142 patients (12.5%) had associated cocaine
      use. Cocaine users were more likely to be younger (mean age: C, 49+/-11; NC,
      53+/-14; P<0.001). There were no differences in rates of poor-grade Hunt and Hess
      (4-5); (C, 21%; NC, 26%; P>0.05), associated intraventricular hemorrhage (C, 56%;
      NC, 51%; P>0.05), or hydrocephalus on admission Head CT (C, 49%; NC, 52%;
      P>0.05). Aneurysm rerupture incidence was higher among cocaine users (C, 7.7%;
      NC, 2.7%; P<0.05). The association of cocaine use with higher risk of delayed
      cerebral ischemia (C, 22%; NC, 16%; P<0.05) was not significant after correcting 
      for other factors. Cocaine users were less likely to survive hospitalization
      compared with nonusers (mortality: C, 26%; NC, 17%; P<0.05); the adjusted odds of
      hospital mortality were 2.9 times higher among cocaine users (P<0.001). There
      were no differences in functional outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Acute cocaine use was associated with a higher risk of aneurysm rerupture and
      hospital mortality after aSAH.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment of rhabdoid glioblastoma.
PG  - 412-9
LID - 10.3171/2013.3.JNS121773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Rhabdoid glioblastoma (GB) is an exceedingly rare tumor in which some of 
      the tumor cells possess rhabdoid features such as eccentric nuclei, abundant
      eosinophilic cytoplasm, and pseudopapillary formations. These tumors are
      exceptionally aggressive, and leptomeningeal dissemination is common. In the 9
      previously reported cases, the longest survival was only 9 months, with a median 
      survival of 17.8 weeks. The authors report the clinicopathological
      characteristics of 4 cases of rhabdoid GB and demonstrate the utility of
      intensive temozolomide and adjuvant therapy in these tumors. The authors also
      review the literature to provide the most comprehensive understanding of these
      rare tumors to date. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients
      treated for GB at the Duke University Medical Center between 2004 and 2012. One
      of two experienced neuropathologists identified 4 cases as being rhabdoid GBs.
      Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were
      performed in all cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess overall
      survival, with the log-rank test being used to evaluate differences between
      survival curves. An extensive review of the literature was also performed.
      RESULTS: The median age of patients with rhabdoid GB was 30 years. Clinical
      presentation varied with location, with headache being a presenting symptom in
      90% of patients. All lesions were supratentorial, and 45.5% of the cases involved
      the temporal lobe. Leptomeningeal dissemination occurred in 63.6% of patients,
      with 1 patient having extracranial metastasis to the scalp and lungs.
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed epidermal growth factor receptor gain
      or amplification in all study cases. The median survival in the authors' cohort
      was significantly higher than that of all previously reported cases (27.5 vs 4.5 
      months, p = 0.003). Postoperative treatment in the authors' cohort included
      radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, bevacizumab, interleukin 13, CCNU,
      and/or etoposide. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced survival in the authors' 4 patients
      suggests that the current standard of care for the treatment of GB may be
      beneficial in rhabdoid GB cases, with postoperative radiotherapy and concomitant 
      temozolomide treatment followed by adjuvant therapy. Due to the rapid tumor
      dissemination associated with these lesions, aggressive and timely therapy is
      warranted, with frequent surveillance and/or continued therapy despite stable
      disease. Additionally, patients should undergo full craniospinal imaging to
      monitor the development of distant metastatic disease.

TI  - Downregulation of miR-124 promotes the growth and invasiveness of glioblastoma
      cells involving upregulation of PPP1R13L.
PG  - 101-7
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1365 [doi]
AB  - microRNA-124 (miR-124) plays an important role in regulating growth,
      invasiveness, stem-like traits, differentiation and apoptosis of glioblastoma
      cells. PPP1R3L, an inhibitory member of the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 
      family (IASPP), is also able to affect growth, cell cycle progression, metastasis
      and apoptosis of various types of cancer. To investigate the regulation of
      PPP1R13L expression by miR-124 and their effects on proliferation, cell cycle
      transition and invasion in glioblastoma cells, U251 and U373 glioblastoma cells
      were transfected with miR-124 mimics, its negative control (NC) or an inhibitor. 
      We found that miR-124 was downregulated in glioblastoma tissues, and inversely
      regulated PPP1R13L expression in U251 and U373 glioblastoma cells. PPP1R13L was
      found to be a direct target of miR-124 in glioblastoma cells. Overexpression of
      miR-124 inhibited proliferation, G1/S transition and invasiveness in glioblastoma
      cells. miR-124 downregulation-mediated malignant progression of glioblastoma was 
      partly attributed to increased PPP1R13L expression. Consequently, our findings
      provide a molecular basis for the role of miR-124/PPP1R13L in the progression of 
      human glioblastoma and suggest a novel target for the treatment of glioblastoma.

TI  - Thymus transplantation restores the repertoires of forkhead box protein 3
      (FoxP3)+ and FoxP3- T cells in complete DiGeorge anomaly.
PG  - 140-9
LID - 10.1111/cei.12088 [doi]
AB  - The development of T cells with a regulatory phenotype after thymus
      transplantation has not been examined previously in complete DiGeorge anomaly
      (cDGA). Seven athymic infants with cDGA and non-maternal pretransplantation T
      cell clones were assessed. Pretransplantation forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3)(+) T
      cells were detected in five of the subjects. Two subjects were studied in greater
      depth. T cell receptor variable beta chain (TCR-Vbeta) expression was assessed by
      flow cytometry. In both subjects, pretransplantation FoxP3(+) and total CD4(+) T 
      cells showed restricted TCR-Vbeta expression. The development of naive T cells
      and diverse CD4(+) TCR-Vbeta repertoires following thymic transplantation
      indicated successful thymopoiesis from the thymic tissue grafts. Infants with
      atypical cDGA develop rashes and autoimmune phenomena before transplantation,
      requiring treatment with immunosuppression, which was discontinued successfully
      subsequent to the observed thymopoiesis. Post-transplantation, diverse TCR-Vbeta 
      family expression was also observed in FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells. Interestingly,
      the percentages of each of the TCR-Vbeta families expressed on FoxP3(+) and total
      CD4(+) T cells differed significantly between these T lymphocyte subpopulations
      before transplantation. By 16 months post-transplantation, however, the
      percentages of expression of each TCR-Vbeta family became significantly similar
      between FoxP3(+) and total CD4(+) T cells. Sequencing of TCRBV DNA confirmed the 
      presence of clonally amplified pretransplantation FoxP3(+) and FoxP3(-) T cells. 
      After thymus transplantation, increased polyclonality was observed for both
      FoxP3(+) and FoxP3(-) cells, and pretransplantation FoxP3(+) and FoxP3(-)
      clonotypes essentially disappeared. Thus, post-transplantation thymic function
      was associated with the development of a diverse repertoire of FoxP3(+) T cells
      in cDGA, corresponding with immunological and clinical recovery.

LID - 10.1177/1059840513485986 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed the anthropometrics and acanthosis nigricans (AN) in a sample
      of 7,337 children at two assessments. Four groups of children were identified
      based on the presence of AN at both time points: those who never had the marker, 
      those who gained the marker, those who lost the marker, and those who maintained 
      the marker. Group differences in height, weight, body composition, and the amount
      of change in these variables over time were explored. Our findings demonstrated
      that children who maintain or gain the AN marker had the greatest height, weight,
      and body composition changes over time. It is apparent that the AN marker does
      disappear in some children and that this is associated with lower weight gain and
      body composition loss. If interventions can be developed targeting children who
      present with the marker, it is likely that their risk of developing type 2
      diabetes could be reduced.

TI  - Heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - 157-73
AB  - The heart failure syndrome has been recognized as a significant contributor to
      cardiovascular disease burden in sub-Saharan African for many decades. Seminal
      knowledge regarding heart failure in the region came from case reports and case
      series of the early 20th century which identified infectious, nutritional and
      idiopathic causes as the most common. With increasing urbanization, changes in
      lifestyle habits, and ageing of the population, the spectrum of causes of HF has 
      also expanded resulting in a significant burden of both communicable and
      non-communicable etiologies. Heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa is notable for
      the range of etiologies that concurrently exist as well as the healthcare
      environment marked by limited resources, weak national healthcare systems and a
      paucity of national level data on disease trends. With the recent publication of 
      the first and largest multinational prospective registry of acute heart failure
      in sub-Saharan Africa, it is timely to review the state of knowledge to date and 
      describe the myriad forms of heart failure in the region. This review discusses
      several forms of heart failure that are common in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g.,
      rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, pericardial disease, various
      dilated cardiomyopathies, HIV cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
      endomyocardial fibrosis, ischemic heart disease, cor pulmonale) and presents each
      form with regard to epidemiology, natural history, clinical characteristics,
      diagnostic considerations and therapies. Areas and approaches to fill the
      remaining gaps in knowledge are also offered herein highlighting the need for
      research that is driven by regional disease burden and needs.

PG  - 983-7
LID - 10.1007/s00262-013-1405-y [doi]
AB  - B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a cytokine involved in differentiation and
      survival of follicular B cells along with humoral response potentiation.
      Lymphopenia is known to precipitate dramatic elevation in serum BLyS; however,
      the use of this effect to enhance humoral responses following vaccination has not
      been evaluated. We evaluated BLyS serum levels and antigen-specific antibody
      titers in 8 patients undergoing therapeutic temozolomide (TMZ)-induced
      lymphopenia, with concomitant vaccine against a tumor-specific mutation in the
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII). Our studies demonstrate that
      TMZ-induced lymphopenia corresponded with spikes in serum BLyS that directly
      preceded the induction of anti-EGFRvIII antigen-specific antibody titers, in some
      cases as high as 1:2,000,000. Our data are the first clinical observation of BLyS
      serum elevation and greatly enhanced humoral immune responses as a consequence of
      chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia. These observations should be considered for the
      development of future vaccination strategies in the setting of malignancy.

AB  - Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells of neural crest (NC) origin that are
      responsible for protecting the skin against UV irradiation. Pluripotent stem cell
      (PSC) technology offers a promising approach for studying human melanocyte
      development and disease. Here, we report that timed exposure to activators of
      WNT, BMP, and EDN3 signaling triggers the sequential induction of NC and
      melanocyte precursor fates under dual-SMAD-inhibition conditions. Using a
      SOX10::GFP human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter line, we demonstrate that
      the temporal onset of WNT activation is particularly critical for human NC
      induction. Subsequent maturation of hESC-derived melanocytes yields pure
      populations that match the molecular and functional properties of adult
      melanocytes. Melanocytes from Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi
      syndrome patient-specific induced PSCs (iPSCs) faithfully reproduce the
      ultrastructural features of disease-associated pigmentation defects. Our data
      define a highly specific requirement for WNT signaling during NC induction and
      enable the generation of pure populations of human iPSC-derived melanocytes for
      faithful modeling of pigmentation disorders.

AB  - Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis can be caused by a multitude of
      disease processes and may manifest in a variety of histologic patterns. Lupus
      nephritis is an immune complex disease, the diagnosis of which requires that the 
      affected patient have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the absence of SLE, 
      the finding of glomerulonephritis with certain patterns of immune complex
      deposition characteristic of lupus nephritis has been referred to as lupus-like
      glomerulonephritis. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, complement C3, and C1q
      deposition in glomerular immune deposits is one such pattern. We report a case of
      immune complex disease in a primarily membranous distribution with mesangial,
      subendothelial, and tubular basement membrane deposits with IgG, IgA, IgM, C3,
      and C1q deposition in a patient with proteinuria, photosensitive dermatitis, and 
      a positive lupus anticoagulant test. The patient had 3 of the clinical criteria
      for SLE, thus failing to meet the diagnosis based on the American College of
      Rheumatology definition. In this case, a diagnosis of lupus-like
      glomerulonephritis was made after other causes of membranous glomerulopathy were 
      excluded. This teaching case highlights the broad differential diagnosis of this 
      pattern of injury and reviews similar cases in the literature.

AB  - The present study sought to examine the longitudinal psychoeducational,
      neurocognitive, and psychiatric outcomes of children and adolescents with
      chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a population with a high
      incidence of major psychiatric illnesses appearing in late adolescence/early
      adulthood. Little is known of the developmental changes that occur in the early
      teen years, prior to the age of highest psychosis risk. Data were collected from 
      71 participants (42 subjects with 22q11DS and 29 control subjects) at Time 1 (T1)
      and Time 2 (T2), approximately 3.5 years later. The 22q11DS group was
      significantly lower functioning than controls on IQ, neurocognition, and academic
      achievement at both T1 and T2. Children with 22q11DS also showed significantly
      greater social-behavioral difficulties and psychiatric symptoms, and were more
      likely to meet criteria for psychiatric disorders at both time points. In
      evaluating change over time from T1 to T2, the 22q11DS group did not show
      significant changes in psychoeducational or psychiatric outcomes relative to the 
      controls, however, lack of expected age-related gains in attention regulation
      were noted. Within the 22q11DS group, an increase in the Attenuated Prodrome for 
      Schizophrenia (number of psychiatric symptoms) was noted from T1 to T2 and four
      children with 22q11DS met criteria for Psychosis for the first time. Predictors
      at T1 that uncovered psychopathology symptoms at T2 included full-scale IQ,
      externalizing symptoms, and problem social behaviors. Overall, younger adolescent
      and preadolescent children with 22q11DS in this study exhibited slowed growth in 
      attention regulation, with an increase in subclinical symptoms of schizophrenia, 
      suggestive of increasing impairments in domains that are relevant to the high
      risk of Schizophrenia. Early predictors of later psychopathology included both
      cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. These findings begin to elucidate the
      trajectory of changes in psychopathology in children with 22q11DS in the years
      leading up to the onset of major psychiatric illnesses.

PG  - 321-4
LID - 10.1002/jca.21254 [doi]
AB  - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which
      IgG-coated platelets are removed from circulation by the spleen, and platelet
      production is impaired due to increased thrombopoietin (TPO) clearance.
      Romiplostim, a novel TPO-mimetic agent, is approved for patients with ITP that
      are unresponsive to traditional treatments. However, there is little experience
      when using this drug before splenectomy. We describe herein the case of a young
      female with chronic ITP who was treated with romiplostim, underwent splenectomy
      shortly thereafter, and required plateletpheresis for postoperative rebound
      thrombocytosis with concomitant neurologic symptoms.

TI  - Transient receptor potential channels and dermatological disorders.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels are an emerging field of
      research in dermatology. Beyond their classical role in skin sensory perception, 
      TRPs are involved in various cutaneous functions that include keratinocyte
      differentiation, apoptosis and melanocyte pigmentation. In addition, they have a 
      role as pharmacological targets in many inflammatory skin diseases including
      psoriasis, chronic itch, hair disorders and skin cancers. Moreover, mutations in 
      TRPs have recently been related to rare skin conditions such as Olmsted syndrome.
      This review will cover the role of TRPs in dermatologic conditions with special
      emphasis on itch and skin inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Imaging descriptors improve the predictive power of survival models for
      glioblastoma patients.
PG  - 1389-94
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because effective prediction of survival time can be highly
      beneficial for the treatment of glioblastoma patients, the relationship between
      survival time and multiple patient characteristics has been investigated. In this
      paper, we investigate whether the predictive power of a survival model based on
      clinical patient features improves when MRI features are also included in the
      model. METHODS: The subjects in this study were 82 glioblastoma patients for whom
      clinical features as well as MR imaging exams were made available by The Cancer
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Twenty-six imaging
      features in the available MR scans were assessed by radiologists from the TCGA
      Glioma Phenotype Research Group. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards
      regression to construct 2 survival models: one that used 3 clinical features
      (age, gender, and KPS) as the covariates and 1 that used both the imaging
      features and the clinical features as the covariates. Then, we used 2 measures to
      compare the predictive performance of these 2 models: area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve for the 1-year survival threshold and overall
      concordance index. To eliminate any positive performance estimation bias, we used
      leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The performance of the model based on
      both clinical and imaging features was higher than the performance of the model
      based on only the clinical features, in terms of both area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (P < .01) and the overall concordance index (P <
      .01). CONCLUSIONS: Imaging features assessed using a controlled lexicon have
      additional predictive value compared with clinical features when predicting
      survival time in glioblastoma patients.

AB  - The rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) of the fourth ventricle is a
      recently described, rare, and distinct tumor of the glioneuronal family. The
      presentation, natural history, and treatment response of these tumors has been
      unclear as there are no significant series of a sizeable population with
      long-term follow-up. We report a comprehensive analysis of 41 patients with RGNT 
      to provide the most current understanding of this rare tumor. Treatment of these 
      patients has consisted of resection via the transvermian and telovelar
      approaches, with one patient requiring radiotherapy due to tumor recurrence.
      Various unique imaging characteristics may allow for the preoperative
      identification of these tumors. Resection via the telovelar approach should be
      considered for symptomatic tumors and those that pose a risk of obstructive
      hydrocephalus. Due to their benign nature and low propensity for recurrence,
      subtotal resection may be appropriate for those that are adherent to the
      brainstem. Radiotherapy may be considered for patients with tumor recurrence.

TI  - A non-catalytic role of DNA polymerase eta in recruiting Rad18 and promoting PCNA
      monoubiquitination at stalled replication forks.
PG  - 3079-93

AB  - Trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage-tolerance mechanism that uses
      low-fidelity DNA polymerases to replicate damaged DNA. The inherited
      cancer-propensity syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) results from
      error-prone TLS of UV-damaged DNA. TLS is initiated when the Rad6/Rad18 complex
      monoubiquitinates proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), but the basis for
      recruitment of Rad18 to PCNA is not completely understood. Here, we show that
      Rad18 is targeted to PCNA by DNA polymerase eta (Poleta), the XPV gene product
      that is mutated in XPV patients. The C-terminal domain of Poleta binds to both
      Rad18 and PCNA and promotes PCNA monoubiquitination, a function unique to Poleta 
      among Y-family TLS polymerases and dissociable from its catalytic activity.
      Importantly, XPV cells expressing full-length catalytically-inactive Poleta
      exhibit increased recruitment of other error-prone TLS polymerases (Polkappa and 
      Poliota) after UV irradiation. These results define a novel non-catalytic role
      for Poleta in promoting PCNA monoubiquitination and provide a new potential
      mechanism for mutagenesis and genome instability in XPV individuals.

TI  - Kikuchi-Fugimoto's disease in sickle cell disease: report of 2 cases.
PG  - 459-62
AB  - Kikuchi-Fugimoto's Disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing
      lymphadenitis, is most frequently seen in young women and has been associated
      with autoimmune disorders such as polymyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 
      It is generally a self-limiting disease with recovery time ranging from weeks to 
      months. A typical presentation of KFD includes painful cervical lymphadenopathy, 
      usually consisting of unilateral involvement of the posterior cervical chain. To 
      date, this condition has not been described in patients with sickle cell disease.
      We present 2 cases of KFD, 1 in a patient with sickle beta(o)-thalassemia
      (Sbeta(o)thal) and 1 in a patient with sickle cell anemia with hereditary
      persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HbS-HPFH). Both patients were young-adult
      African American females who presented with fever and unilateral tender cervical 
      lymphadenopathy. Extensive infectious disease testing, including cultures and
      viral serologies, were all negative. Imaging was negative for abscesses. The
      first patient had a preceding history of benign carcinoid tumor and idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura. The second patient had no history of autoimmune
      syndromes but was on hydroxyurea therapy at the time of her presentation; the
      first had never taken hydroxyurea. Treatment strategies included prednisone
      therapy in the first case and watchful monitoring in the second. Recovery time
      was approximately 2 months for each patient. Both developed thyroid disease
      subsequent to their episode of KFD. Currently, both patients are asymptomatic
      with no recurrence of KFD or active autoimmune disease.

TI  - Proteasome inhibitor MG132 induces NAG-1/GDF15 expression through the p38 MAPK
      pathway in glioblastoma cells.

AB  - The expression of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 (NAG-1) is
      regulated by the p53 and Egr-1 tumor suppressor pathways. Many anti-cancer drugs 
      and chemicals induce NAG-1 expression, but the mechanisms are not fully
      understood. Transgenic mice expressing human NAG-1 are resistant to intestinal
      and prostate cancer, suggesting that NAG-1 is a tumor suppressor. Proteasome
      inhibitors exhibit anti-glioblastoma activities in preclinical studies. Here, we 
      show that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib induced NAG-1 expression
      and secretion in glioblastoma cells. MG132 increased NAG-1 expression through
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. At the transcriptional
      level, the induction of NAG-1 required the -133 to +41 bp region of the promoter.
      At post-transcriptional levels, MG132 stabilized NAG-1 mRNA by increasing the
      half-life from 1.5 h to >8 h. Because of the dramatic increase in mRNA stability,
      this is likely the major contributor to MG132-mediated NAG-1 induction. Further
      probing into the mechanism revealed that MG132 increased phosphorylation of the
      p38 MAPK pathway. Consequently, inhibiting p38 phosphorylation blocked activation
      of the NAG-1 promoter and decreased mRNA stability, indicating that p38 MAPK
      activation mediates both MG132-dependent promoter activation and mRNA
      stabilization of NAG-1. We propose that the induction of NAG-1 by p38 MAPK is a
      potential contributor to the anti-glioblastoma activity of proteasome inhibitors.

TI  - Limited margins using modern radiotherapy techniques does not increase marginal
      failure rate of glioblastoma.
PG  - 177-81
LID - 10.1097/COC.0b013e318271ae03 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigate the patterns of failure in the treatment of
      glioblastoma (GBM) based on clinical target volume (CTV) margin size, dose
      delivered to the site of initial failure, and the use of temozolomide and
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS: Between August 2000 and May
      2010, 161 patients with GBM were treated with radiotherapy with or without
      concurrent temozolomide. Patients were treated with CTV expansions that ranged
      from 5 to 20 mm using a shrinking field technique. Patterns of failure and time
      to progression and overall survival were compared based on CTV margin, use of
      temozolomide, and use of IMRT. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to estimate
      survival times, and chi test was used for comparison of cohorts. RESULTS: For
      patients treated with 5-, 10-, and 15- to 20-mm CTV, 79%, 77%, and 86%
      experienced failures in the 60 Gy volume, respectively. Forty-eight percent, 55%,
      and 66% of patients with 5-, 10-, and 15- to 20-mm CTV experienced failures in
      the 46 Gy volume, respectively. There was no statistical difference between
      patients treated with 5-, 10-, 15- to 20-mm margins with regard to 60 Gy failure 
      (P=0.76), 46 Gy failure (P=0.51), or marginal failure (P=0.73). Eighty percent of
      patients receiving temozolomide experienced failures in the 60 Gy volume. There
      was no increased likelihood of marginal failures in patients receiving IMRT
      (P=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Modern treatment techniques including use of concurrent
      temozolmide, limited CTV margin size, and IMRT have not greatly changed the
      patterns of failure of GBM.

PG  - 1126-33
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2012.2227477 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an established clinical practice in
      managing patients with risk of acute ICP elevation although the clinically
      accepted way of measuring ICP remains invasive. However, the invasive nature of
      ICP measurement obviates its application in many clinical circumstances such as
      diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IH). We propose a noninvasive 
      diagnostic tool for IH based on the morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow
      velocity waveforms. We mainly compare two types of IH detection methods: one
      based on the traditional supervised learning approach and the other based on the 
      semisupervised learning approach. Our simulation results demonstrate that the
      predictive accuracy (area under the curve) of the semisupervised IH detection
      method can be as high as 92% while that of the supervised IH detection method is 
      only around 82%. It should be noted that the predictive accuracy of the
      pulsatility index (PI)-based IH detection method is as low as 59%. Although the
      predictive accuracy is a widely used accuracy measurement, it does not consider
      clinical consequences of necessary and unnecessary treatments. For this reason,
      we have adopted the decision curve analysis to address this issue. The decision
      curve analysis results show that the semisupervised IH detection method is not
      only more accurate, but also clinically more useful than the supervised IH
      detection method or the PI-based IH detection method.

AB  - A major drawback of internalizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) radioiodinated
      with direct electrophilic approaches is that tumor retention of radioactivity is 
      compromised by the rapid washout of iodo-tyrosine, the primary labeled catabolite
      for mAbs labeled via this strategy. In our continuing efforts to develop more
      versatile residualizing labels that could overcome this problem, we have designed
      SIB-DOTA, a prosthetic labeling template that combines the features of the
      prototypical, dehalogenation-resistant N-succinimidyl 3-iodobenzoate (SIB) with
      DOTA, a useful macrocyclic chelator for labeling with radiometals. Herein we
      describe the synthesis of the unlabeled standard of this prosthetic moiety, its
      protected tin precursor, and radioiodinated SIB-DOTA. An anti-EGFRvIII-reactive
      mAb, L8A4 was radiolabeled with [(131)I]SIB-DOTA in 27.1+/-6.2% (n=2) conjugation
      yields and its targeting properties to the same mAb labeled with [(125)I]SGMIB
      both in vitro and in vivo using U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells and xenografts were
      compared. In vitro paired-label internalization assays showed that the
      intracellular radioactivity from [(131)I]SIB-DOTA-L8A4 was 21.4+/-0.5% and
      26.2+/-1.1% of initially bound radioactivity at 16 and 24h, respectively. In
      comparison, these values for [(125)I]SGMIB-L8A4 were 16.7+/-0.5% and 14.9+/-1.1%.
      Similarly, the SIB-DOTA prosthetic group provided better tumor targeting in vivo 
      than SGMIB over 8 d period. These results suggest that SIB-DOTA warrants further 
      evaluation as a residualizing agent for labeling internalizing mAbs including
      those targeted to EGFRvIII.

AB  - Coordinated migration and placement of interneurons and projection neurons lead
      to functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex; defective neuronal migration
      and the resultant connectivity changes underlie the cognitive defects in a
      spectrum of neurological disorders. Here we show that primary cilia play a
      guiding role in the migration and placement of postmitotic interneurons in the
      developing cerebral cortex and that this process requires the ciliary protein,
      Arl13b. Through live imaging of interneuronal cilia, we show that migrating
      interneurons display highly dynamic primary cilia and we correlate cilia dynamics
      with the interneuron's migratory state. We demonstrate that the guidance cue
      receptors essential for interneuronal migration localize to interneuronal primary
      cilia, but their concentration and dynamics are altered in the absence of Arl13b.
      Expression of Arl13b variants known to cause Joubert syndrome induce defective
      interneuronal migration, suggesting that defects in cilia-dependent interneuron
      migration may in part underlie the neurological defects in Joubert syndrome
      patients.

TI  - Recombinant anti-podoplanin (NZ-1) immunotoxin for the treatment of malignant
      brain tumors.
PG  - 2339-48
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27919 [doi]
AB  - Our study demonstrates the glioma tumor antigen podoplanin to be present at very 
      high levels (>90%) in both glioblastoma (D2159MG, D08-0308MG and D08-0493MG) and 
      medulloblastoma (D283MED, D425MED and DAOY) xenografts and cell line. We
      constructed a novel recombinant single-chain antibody variable region fragment
      (scFv), NZ-1, specific for podoplanin from the NZ-1 hybridoma. NZ-1-scFv was then
      fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin A, carrying a C-terminal KDEL peptide
      (NZ-1-PE38KDEL). The immunotoxin (IT) was further stabilized by a disulfide (ds) 
      bond between the heavy-chain and light-chain variable regions as the construct
      NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL. NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL exhibited significant reactivity
      to glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells. The affinity of NZ-1-(scdsFv),
      NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL and NZ-1 antibody for podoplanin peptide was 2.1 x 10(-8) 
      M, 8.0 x 10(-8) M and 3.9 x 10(-10) M, respectively. In a protein stability
      assay, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL retained 33-98% of its activity, whereas that of
      NZ-1-PE38KDEL declined to 13% of its initial levels after incubation at 37
      degrees C for 3 days. In vitro cytotoxicity of the NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL was
      measured in cells isolated from glioblastoma xenografts, D2159MG, D08-0308MG and 
      D08-0493MG, and in the medulloblastoma D283MED, D425MED and DOAY xenografts and
      cell line. The NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL IT was highly cytotoxic, with an 50%
      inhibitory concentration in the range of 1.6-29 ng/ml. Significantly,
      NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL demonstrated tumor growth delay, averaging 24 days (p <
      0.001) and 21 days (p < 0.001) in D2159MG and D283MED in vivo tumor models,
      respectively. Crucially, in the D425MED intracranial tumor model,
      NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL caused a 41% increase in survival (p </= 0.001). In
      preclinical studies, NZ-1-(scdsFv)-PE38KDEL exhibited significant potential as a 
      targeting agent for malignant brain tumors.

TI  - Mibefradil, a novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme: cell cycle
      synchronization and interlaced therapy in a murine model.
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.1007/s11060-012-0995-0 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis
      and a very limited response to treatment. The current standard of care for GBM
      usually consists of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent
      temozolomide, although resistance to this drug is common. The predominant
      mechanism of action of temozolomide is methylation of guanine residues although
      this can be reversed by methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) as well as other
      DNA repair systems. The presence of methylguanine causes abortive DNA synthesis
      with subsequent apoptosis. This suggests that the closer a particular cell is to 
      S phase when it is exposed to temozolomide the more likely it is to die since
      repair enzymes will have had less time to reverse the damage. T type calcium
      channel inhibitors can stop the entry of extracellular calcium that is necessary 
      for transit past the G1/S boundary. As a result, T type calcium channel blockers 
      can slow the growth of cancer cells, but do not generally kill them. Though
      slowing the growth of cancer cells is important in its own right, it also
      provides a therapeutic strategy in which a T type channel blocker is administered
      then withdrawn followed by the administration of temozolomide. We show here that 
      imposing this cell cycle restriction increases the efficacy of subsequently
      administered temozolomide in immunodeficient mice bearing various human GBM
      xenograft lines. We also present data that MGMT expressing GBM tumors, which are 
      temozolomide resistant, may be rendered more sensitive by this strategy.

TI  - Bilaterally symmetrical alopecia with reticulated hyperpigmentation: a
      manifestation of cutaneous lupus erythematosus in a dog with systemic lupus
      erythematosus.
PG  - 682-5
LID - 10.1177/0300985812463406 [doi]
AB  - An adult castrated male Doberman Pinscher was presented with a 6-month history of
      well-demarcated alopecic patches with reticulated hyperpigmentation and fine
      peripheral scaling on the axillae, thorax, abdomen, inguinal region, and thighs. 
      The dog later developed hyperthermia, lethargy, apparent joint pain, peripheral
      lymphadenomegaly, vomiting, and diarrhea. Relevant laboratory tests results
      included anemia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and an elevated antinuclear
      antibodies serum titer. Histologically, skin biopsy specimens had a
      lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis and interface mural folliculitis ending in
      follicular destruction. Altogether, these signs were consistent with a unique
      alopecic variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, eventually associated 
      with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. This rare form of chronic
      cutaneous lupus needs to be added to the expanding list of lymphocyte-mediated
      autoimmune alopecias in dogs.

TI  - Bevacizumab continuation beyond initial bevacizumab progression among recurrent
      glioblastoma patients.
PG  - 1481-7
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome for most recurrent glioblastoma
      patients, but the duration of benefit is limited and survival after initial
      bevacizumab progression is poor. We evaluated bevacizumab continuation beyond
      initial progression among recurrent glioblastoma patients as it is a common, yet 
      unsupported practice in some countries. METHODS: We analysed outcome among all
      patients (n=99) who received subsequent therapy after progression on one of five 
      consecutive, single-arm, phase II clinical trials evaluating bevacizumab regimens
      for recurrent glioblastoma. Of note, the five trials contained similar
      eligibility, treatment and assessment criteria, and achieved comparable outcome. 
      RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) and OS at 6 months for patients who
      continued bevacizumab therapy (n=55) were 5.9 months (95% confidence interval
      (CI): 4.4, 7.6) and 49.2% (95% CI: 35.2, 61.8), compared with 4.0 months (95% CI:
      2.1, 5.4) and 29.5% (95% CI: 17.0, 43.2) for patients treated with a
      non-bevacizumab regimen (n=44; P=0.014). Bevacizumab continuation was an
      independent predictor of improved OS (hazard ratio=0.64; P=0.04). CONCLUSION: The
      results of our retrospective pooled analysis suggest that bevacizumab
      continuation beyond initial progression modestly improves survival compared with 
      available non-bevacizumab therapy for recurrent glioblastoma patients require
      evaluation in an appropriately randomised, prospective trial.

TI  - Pulmonary fibrosis: patterns and perpetrators.
PG  - 2756-62
LID - 10.1172/JCI60323 [doi]
LID - 60323 [pii]
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis occurs in a variety of clinical settings, constitutes a major 
      cause of morbidity and mortality, and represents an enormous unmet medical need. 
      However, the disease is heterogeneous, and the failure to accurately discern
      between forms of fibrosing lung diseases leads to inaccurate treatments.
      Pulmonary fibrosis occurring in the context of connective tissue diseases is
      often characterized by a distinct pattern of tissue pathology and may be amenable
      to immunosuppressive therapies. In contrast, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      is a progressive and lethal form of fibrosing lung disease that is recalcitrant
      to therapies that target the immune system. Although animal models of fibrosis
      imperfectly recapitulate IPF, they have yielded numerous targets for therapeutic 
      intervention. Understanding the heterogeneity of these diseases and elucidating
      the final common pathways of fibrogenesis are critical for the development of
      efficacious therapies for severe fibrosing lung diseases.

PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/1465-9921-13-62 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial
      pneumonia causing a loss of respiratory surface area due to a proliferative
      fibrotic response involving hyperplastic, hypertrophic, and metaplastic
      epithelium, cystic honeycomb change, septal expansion, and variable inflammation.
      Wnt (wingless) signaling glycoproteins are known to be involved in lung
      development and tissue repair, and are up-regulated in patients with IPF. Based
      on previous qRT-PCR data showing increased Wnt7B in lungs of IPF patients, a
      systematic, quantitative examination of its tissue site distribution was
      undertaken. METHODS: Tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium
      (LTRC) of 39 patients diagnosed with mild to severe IPF/usual interstitial
      pneumonia (UIP) and 19 normal patients were examined for the immunolocalization
      of Wnt7B. RESULTS: In normal lung, moderate Wnt7B reactivity was confined to
      airway epithelium, smooth muscle of airways and vasculature, and macrophages. IPF
      lung showed strong Wnt7B reactivity in fibroblastic foci, dysplastic airway and
      alveolar epithelium, and in highly discrete subepithelial, basement
      membrane-associated regions. All reactive sites were sized and counted relative
      to specific microscopic regions. Those in the subepithelial sites were found in
      significantly greater numbers and larger relative area compared with the others. 
      No reactive sites were present in normal patient controls. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results demonstrate Wnt7B to be expressed at high concentrations in regions of
      active hyperplasia, metaplasia, and fibrotic change in IPF patients. In this
      context and its previously established biologic activities, Wnt7B would be
      expected to be of potential importance in the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - Dysregulation of DGCR6 and DGCR6L: psychopathological outcomes in chromosome
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
PG  - e105
LID - 10.1038/tp.2012.31 [doi]
AB  - Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the most common microdeletion
      syndrome in humans. It is typified by highly variable symptoms, which might be
      explained by epigenetic regulation of genes in the interval. Using computational 
      algorithms, our laboratory previously predicted that DiGeorge critical region 6
      (DGCR6), which lies within the deletion interval, is imprinted in humans.
      Expression and epigenetic regulation of this gene have not, however, been
      examined in 22q11DS subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
      expression levels of DGCR6 and its duplicate copy DGCR6L in 22q11DS subjects are 
      associated with the parent-of-origin of the deletion and childhood
      psychopathologies. Our investigation showed no evidence of
      parent-of-origin-related differences in expression of both DGCR6 and DGCR6L.
      However, we found that the variability in DGCR6 expression was significantly
      greater in 22q11DS children than in age and gender-matched control individuals.
      Children with 22q11DS who had anxiety disorders had significantly lower DGCR6
      expression, especially in subjects with the deletion on the maternal chromosome, 
      despite the lack of imprinting. Our findings indicate that epigenetic mechanisms 
      other than imprinting contribute to the dysregulation of these genes and the
      associated childhood psychopathologies observed in individuals with 22q11DS.
      Further studies are now needed to test the usefulness of DGCR6 and DGCR6L
      expression and alterations in the epigenome at these loci in predicting childhood
      anxiety and associated adult-onset pathologies in 22q11DS subjects.

TI  - The therapeutic management of bleeding and thrombotic disorders complicating CNS 
      malignancies.
PG  - 451-64
LID - 10.1007/s11864-012-0207-3 [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Patients with central nervous system (CNS) malignancies have a
      substantial risk for developing both thrombotic and bleeding disorders. The risk 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is substantially higher in these patients, both
      in the perioperative period and throughout their disease course. Patients with
      CNS malignancy harbor a latent hypercoagulability, which predisposes to VTE, as
      do postoperative immobility, hemiparesis, and other factors. The management of
      VTE in these patients is complex, given the significant morbidity and mortality
      associated with intratumoral hemorrhage. In the past, the perceived risk of
      intracranial hemorrhage limited the use of anticoagulation for the management of 
      VTE with many favoring nonpharmacologic methods for prophylaxis and treatment.
      Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have since lost favor at many centers given
      significant complications, which appear to be more frequent in patients with CNS 
      malignancy. Recent studies have demonstrated safe and efficacious use of
      anticoagulation in these patients with a low incidence of intracranial
      hemorrhage. Treatment of established VTE is now recommended in this population
      with many centers favoring low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus oral
      warfarin for short- or long-term treatment. We advocate a multimodality approach 
      utilizing compression stockings, intermittent compression devices, and heparin in
      the perioperative setting as the best proven method to reduce the risk of VTE. In
      the absence of a strict contraindication to systemic anticoagulation, such as
      previous intracranial hemorrhage or profound thrombocytopenia, we recommend LMWH 
      in patients with newly diagnosed VTE and a CNS malignancy.

TI  - Influence of gestational age on death and neurodevelopmental outcome in premature
      infants with severe intracranial hemorrhage.
PG  - 25-32
LID - 10.1038/jp.2012.91 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether death and/or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) 
      after severe intracranial hemorrhage (ICH; grade 3 or 4) differs by gestational
      age (GA) at birth in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. STUDY DESIGN:
      Demographic, perinatal and neonatal factors potentially contributing to NDI for
      ELBW infants (23 to 28 weeks gestation) were obtained retrospectively; outcome
      data came from the ELBW Follow-up Study. NDI was defined at 18 to 22 months
      corrected age as moderate/severe cerebral palsy, Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development II cognitive or motor score <70, and/or blindness or deafness.
      Characteristics of younger versus older infants with no versus severe ICH
      associated with death or NDI were compared. Generalized linear mixed models
      predicted death or NDI in each GA cohort. RESULT: Of the 6638 infants, 61.8% had 
      no ICH and 13.6% had severe ICH; 39% of survivors had NDI. Risk-adjusted odds of 
      death or NDI and death were higher in the lower GA group. Lower GA increased the 
      odds of death before 30 days for infants with severe ICH. Necrotizing
      enterocolitis (particularly surgical NEC), late onset infection, cystic
      periventricular leukomalacia and post-natal steroids contributed to mortality
      risk. NDI differed by GA in infants without ICH and grade 3, but not grade 4 ICH.
      Contributors to NDI in infants with severe ICH included male gender, surgical NEC
      and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring a shunt. CONCLUSION: GA contributes 
      to the risk of death in ELBW infants, but not NDI among survivors with severe
      ICH. Male gender, surgical NEC and need for a shunt add additional risk for NDI.

TI  - Increased corpus callosum volume in children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion
      syndrome is associated with neurocognitive deficits and genetic polymorphisms.
PG  - 1051-7
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.138 [doi]
AB  - Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with neurocognitive 
      impairments. The neural substrates of cognitive impairments in 22q11DS remain
      poorly understood. Because the corpus callosum (CC) is found to be abnormal in a 
      variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, we obtained volumetric measurements of
      the CC and its subregions, examined the relationship between these regions and
      neurocognition and selected genotypes within candidate genes in the 22q11.2
      interval in 59 children with 22q11DS and 53 control subjects. The total CC,
      splenium and genu were significantly larger in children with 22q11DS and the
      enlargement was associated with better neurocognitive functioning in the 22q11DS 
      group, suggestive of a compensatory increase in the CC volumes. The expected
      age-related increase in the volume of the CC was not seen in children with
      22q11DS, indicative of dysmaturation of the CC in these children. The increased
      volumes in the genu, splenium and total CC in the 22q11DS group were associated
      with polymorphisms within the candidate genes: COMT (rs4680), ZDHHC8 (rs175174)
      and UFD1L (rs5992403). These findings indicate that alterations in the CC volume 
      in children with 22q11DS are associated with cognition and specific genotypes in 
      the 22q11.2 interval.

TI  - Bleeding and mortality outcomes in ITP clinical trials: a review of
      thrombopoietin mimetics data.
PG  - 984-7
LID - 10.1002/ajh.23275 [doi]
AB  - Patients with ITP may have severe thrombocytopenia, putting them at risk for
      serious bleeding. ITP trials of new treatments must allow use of standard-of-care
      therapies to prevent serious bleeding. Thrombopoietin mimetic trials used
      platelet counts and rescue/concomitant medication use as endpoints. These trials 
      were of insufficient size and duration to measure mortality or serious bleeding, 
      which are infrequent with appropriate treatment. A recent Cochrane review
      criticized the thrombopoietin mimetic registrational trials for inadequately
      assessing bleeding and survival. We discuss how these endpoints are difficult to 
      measure in clinical trials designed to improve platelet counts and minimize
      bleeding, in accordance with ethical trial design.

TI  - Variation in perioperative care across centers for infants undergoing the Norwood
      procedure.

LID - S0022-5223(12)00560-0 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial, infants undergoing the 
      Norwood procedure were randomly allocated to undergo a right
      ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt or a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Apart
      from shunt type, subjects received the local standard of care. We evaluated
      variation in perioperative care during the Norwood hospitalization across 14
      trial sites. METHODS: Data on preoperative, operative, and postoperative
      variables for 546 enrolled subjects who underwent the Norwood procedure were
      collected prospectively on standardized case report forms, and variation across
      the centers was described. RESULTS: Gestational age, birth weight, and proportion
      with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were similar across sites. In contrast, all 
      recorded variables related to preoperative care varied across centers, including 
      fetal diagnosis (range, 55%-85%), preoperative intubation (range, 29%-91%), and
      enteral feeding. Perioperative and operative factors were also variable across
      sites, including median total support time (range, 74-189 minutes) and other
      perfusion variables, arch reconstruction technique, intraoperative medication
      use, and use of modified ultrafiltration (range, 48%-100%). Additional variation 
      across centers was seen in variables related to postoperative care, including
      proportion with an open sternum (range, 35%-100%), median intensive care unit
      stay (range, 9-44 days), type of feeding at discharge, and enrollment in a home
      monitoring program (range, 1%-100%; 5 sites did not have a program). Overall,
      in-hospital death or transplant occurred in 18% (range across sites, 7%-39%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative care during the Norwood hospitalization varies across 
      centers. Further analysis evaluating the underlying causes and relationship of
      this variation to outcome is needed to inform future studies and quality
      improvement efforts.

TI  - Stereotactic radiosurgery and bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 695-9
AB  - Despite contemporary surgery, image-guided radiotherapy, and chemotherapy,
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) persists or relapses in nearly all patients, and
      tumors almost always recur locally. Management of recurrent GBM is variable, but 
      approaches include best supportive care, reoperation, reirradiation, and/or
      systemic therapy. Promising novel therapies include antiangiogenic agents and
      stereotactic radiosurgery, which have cytotoxic effects on tumor
      microvasculature. Emerging data suggest the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab
      and radiosurgery either alone or in combination. This report presents the case of
      a man with locally recurrent GBM treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and
      concurrent bevacizumab, and reviews the preclinical and clinical data supporting 
      this approach.

TI  - Toward intracellular targeted delivery of cancer therapeutics: progress and

AB  - A number of anti-cancer drugs have their targets localized to particular
      intracellular compartments. These drugs reach the targets mainly through
      diffusion, dependent on biophysical and biochemical forces that allow cell
      penetration. This means that both cancer cells and normal cells will be subjected
      to such diffusion; hence many of these drugs, like chemotherapeutics, are
      potentially toxic and the concentration achieved at the site of their action is
      often suboptimal. The same relates to radiation that indiscriminately affects
      normal and diseased cells. However, nature-designed systems enable compounds
      present in the extracellular environment to end up inside the cell and even
      travel to more specific intracellular compartments. For example, viruses and
      bacterial toxins can more or less specifically recognize eukaryotic cells, enter 
      these cells, and direct some protein portions to designated intracellular areas. 
      These phenomena have led to creative thinking, such as employing viruses or
      bacterial toxins for cargo delivery to cells and, more specifically, to cancer
      cells. Proteins can be genetically engineered in order to not only mimic what
      viruses and bacterial toxins can do, but also to add new functions, extending or 
      changing the intracellular routes. It is possible to make conjugates or, more
      preferably, single-chain proteins that recognize cancer cells and deliver cargo
      inside the cells, even to the desired subcellular compartment. These findings
      offer new opportunities to deliver drugs/labels only to cancer cells and only to 
      their site of action within the cells. The development of such dual-specificity
      vectors for targeting cancer cells is an attractive and potentially safer and
      more efficacious way of delivering drugs. We provide examples of this approach
      for delivering brain cancer therapeutics, using a specific biomarker on
      glioblastoma tumor cells.

      tumors.
PG  - 95-102
LID - 10.1007/s00280-012-1889-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Preclinical data suggest concurrent inhibition of VEGF, mTOR and EGFR
      pathways may augment antitumor and antiangiogenic effects compared to inhibition 
      of each pathway alone. This study evaluated the maximum tolerated
      dose/recommended phase II dose and safety and tolerability of bevacizumab,
      everolimus and panitumumab drug combination. METHODS: Subjects with advanced
      solid tumors received escalating doses of everolimus and flat dosing of
      panitumumab at 4.8 mg/kg and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) were assessed in cycle 1; toxicity evaluation was closely
      monitored throughout treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or 
      undesirable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-two subjects were evaluable for toxicity;
      31 subjects were evaluable for tumor response. DLTs were observed in cohorts with
      everolimus at 10 and 5 mg daily and included grade 3 mucositis, skin rash and
      thrombocytopenia. Therefore, everolimus was dose-reduced to 5 mg three times
      weekly, which improved the tolerability of the treatment regimen. Common adverse 
      events were skin rash/pruritus (91 %), mucositis/stomatitis (75 %),
      hypomagnesemia (72 %), hypocalcemia (56 %) and hypokalemia (50 %). There were 3
      partial responses; an additional 10 subjects had stable disease >/=6 months.
      Three subjects with ovarian cancer and one with endometrial cancer achieved
      prolonged disease control ranging from 11 to >40 months. CONCLUSIONS: The
      recommended phase II dose is everolimus at 5 mg three times weekly plus
      panitumumab at 4.8 mg/kg and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This dosing
      regimen has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and appears to have
      moderate the clinical activity in refractory tumors.

TI  - Altered development of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in chromosome 22q11.2
      deletion syndrome: an in vivo proton spectroscopy study.
PG  - 684-91

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), the most common
      microdeletion in humans, is associated with multiple medical features, almost
      universal cognitive deficits, and a high risk of schizophrenia. The metabolic
      basis of the psychological/psychiatric features is not well understood.
      Volumetric brain imaging studies have shown that gray matter abnormalities in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area that is believed to be integral
      for higher neurocognition, as well as being involved in schizophrenia, are
      associated with the psychological manifestations. However, studies have not
      characterized any possible metabolite alterations within the DLPFC of children
      with 22q11DS and their correlations with the psychological findings. METHODS: We 
      conducted a short echo time, single-voxel, in vivo proton spectroscopy study
      involving children with 22q11DS (n = 26) and matched control subjects (n = 23).
      RESULTS: Absolute N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels from the DLPFC were
      significantly elevated in children with 22q11DS compared with control subjects
      and the elevations were associated with poor global functioning and higher rates 
      of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Children with 22q11DS had a
      lack of an age-associated decrease in NAA levels, a trend seen in the control
      subjects. However, the results did not remain statistically significant after
      corrections for multiple comparisons were made. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      represent the first report of proton spectroscopy in children with 22q11DS. The
      elevated DLPFC NAA levels and the lack of decreasing trends in NAA with age in
      the 22q11DS group relative to control subjects suggest an alteration in cortical 
      development. Also, such neuronal dysmaturation is associated with psychopathology
      in children with 22q11DS.

AB  - This article highlights the most common causes of velopharyngeal insufficiency
      (VPI), and discusses routine evaluation and treatment algorithms for the
      management of VPI in children. VPI is a multifactorial condition that occurs
      commonly in syndromic and non-syndromic children. The most common features of VPI
      are audible hypernasal speech, facial grimacing, decreased speech
      intelligibility, nasal regurgitation, and nasal emission from failure to produce 
      oronasal separation. Work-up of VPI typically involves radiologic and endoscopic 
      testing performed with the assistance of a speech-language pathologist.
      Management of VPI involves initial speech therapy followed by operative repair
      with sphincter or pharyngeal flap pharyngoplasty, if needed.

LID - 10.1177/0022219412443556 [doi]
AB  - Chromosome 22qll.2 deletion syndrome (22qllDS) is the most common microdeletion
      in humans. Nonverbal learning disability (NLD) has been used to describe the
      strengths and deficits of children with 22q11DS, but the applicability of the
      label for this population has seldom been systematically evaluated. The goal of
      the current study was to address how well the NLD diagnosis characterizes
      children and adolescents with 22q11DS. A total of 74 children and adolescents
      with 22q11DS were given neurocognitive, socioemotional, and academic assessments 
      to measure aspects of NLD. Of the cohort, 20% met at least 7 of 9 assessed
      criteria for NLD; 25% showed verbal skills exceeding their nonverbal skills as
      assessed by an IQ test; and 24% showed the good rote verbal capacity commonly
      associated with NLD. Hypothesizing that if the entire cohort did not show
      consistent NLD characteristics, the descriptor might be more accurate for a
      distinct subgroup, the authors used latent class analysis to divide participants 
      into three subgroups. However, the lines along which the groups broke out were
      more related to general functioning level than to NLD criteria. All three groups 
      showed a heightened risk for psychiatric illness, highlighting the importance of 
      careful mental health monitoring for all children with 22qllDS.

AB  - The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the most malignant adult 
      glial brain tumor, remains poor in spite of advances in treatment procedures,
      including surgical resection, irradiation, and chemotherapy. Genetic
      heterogeneity of glioblastoma warrants extensive studies to gain a thorough
      understanding of the biology of this tumor. While there have been several studies
      of global transcript profiling of glioma with the identification of gene
      signatures for diagnosis and disease management, translation into clinics is yet 
      to happen. In the present study, we report a novel proteomic approach by using
      two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by spot picking and
      analysis of proteins/peptides by Mass spectrometry. We report at least ten
      different novel proteins/peptides as identified by this technique which are
      differentially expressed in this cancer and could be of further importance for
      diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic approaches.

TI  - Thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 612-22
AB  - Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 x 10(3) per
      microL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count
      during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional
      investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 x 10(3) 
      per microL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 x 10(3) per
      microL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 x 10(3) per microL may 
      cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 x 10(3) per
      microL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency.
      Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder
      usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most 
      likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, 
      thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated
      intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy,
      preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet
      count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated
      thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational
      thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can
      differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be
      treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in
      some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet
      counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require
      hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia
      worsens despite initial treatment.

TI  - SOX2 hypomorphism disrupts development of the prechordal floor and optic cup.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1016/j.mod.2012.04.001 [doi]
AB  - Haploinsufficiency for the HMG-box transcription factor SOX2 results in
      abnormalities of the human ventral forebrain and its derivative structures. These
      defects include anophthalmia (absence of eye), microphthalmia (small eye) and
      hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), an overgrowth of the ventral hypothalamus. To
      determine how Sox2 deficiency affects the morphogenesis of the ventral
      diencephalon and eye, we generated a Sox2 allelic series (Sox2(IR), Sox2(LP), and
      Sox2(EGFP)), allowing for the generation of mice that express germline
      hypomorphic levels (<40%) of SOX2 protein and that faithfully recapitulate SOX2
      haploinsufficient human phenotypes. We find that Sox2 hypomorphism significantly 
      disrupts the development of the posterior hypothalamus, resulting in an ectopic
      protuberance of the prechordal floor, an upregulation of Shh signaling, and
      abnormal hypothalamic patterning. In the anterior diencephalon, both the optic
      stalks and optic cups (OC) of Sox2 hypomorphic (Sox2(HYP)) embryos are malformed.
      Furthermore, Sox2(HYP) eyes exhibit a loss of neural potential and coloboma, a
      common phenotype in SOX2 haploinsufficient humans that has not been described in 
      a mouse model of SOX2 deficiency. These results establish for the first time that
      germline Sox2 hypomorphism disrupts the morphogenesis and patterning of the
      hypothalamus, optic stalk, and the early OC, establishing a model of the
      development of the abnormalities that are observed in SOX2 haploinsufficient
      humans.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of fentanyl sublingual spray for the treatment of
      breakthrough cancer pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 859-70
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2012.683111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of transmucosal fentanyl formulations have
      been developed for the management of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP). Sublingual 
      delivery of fentanyl, formulated as fentanyl sublingual spray, offers the
      potential for more rapid and greater absorption of fentanyl and associated onset 
      of analgesic effect compared with other formulations. The objective of this study
      was to assess the efficacy and safety of fentanyl sublingual spray for the
      treatment of BTCP. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial conducted in opioid-tolerant
      patients with BTCP. An open-label titration period was followed by a double-blind
      treatment period during which patients received fentanyl sublingual spray
      (100-1600 mcg) or placebo. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov
      NCT00538850. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was summed pain 
      intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID(30)). Secondary efficacy measures
      included total pain relief at 30 minutes (TOTPAR(30)) and patient global
      evaluation of study medication at 30 minutes. Efficacy measures were also
      assessed at various time points from 5-60 minutes postdose. Adverse events were
      monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were treated
      during the titration period, of whom 98 (75.4%) entered the double-blind period. 
      Relative to placebo, fentanyl sublingual spray significantly improved mean SPID
      scores from 5 minutes (p = 0.0219) through 60 minutes (p < 0.0001), including the
      primary endpoint at 30 minutes (p < 0.0001). Fentanyl sublingual spray produced
      significantly greater pain relief (expressed in terms of TOTPAR) from 5 through
      60 minutes (p < 0.0001), and significantly greater global evaluation of treatment
      effectiveness (p < 0.0001), compared with placebo. During double-blind treatment,
      the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (7.1%), hyperhidrosis
      (5.1%), and peripheral edema (5.1%). Serious adverse events occurred in seven
      patients (5.4%) during titration and six (6.1%) during double-blind treatment;
      none were considered related to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate
      that treatment with fentanyl sublingual spray results in effective relief of
      BTCP, with a rapid onset of action, and is well tolerated.

TI  - Clinical, radiological, and genetic similarities between patients with Chiari
      Type I and Type 0 malformations.
PG  - 372-8
LID - 10.3171/2011.12.PEDS11113 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Although Chiari Type I (CM-I) and Type 0 (CM-0) malformations have been
      previously characterized clinically and radiologically, there have been no
      studies focusing on the possible genetic link between these disorders. The goal
      of this study was to identify families in whom CM-0 and CM-I co-occurred and to
      further assess the similarities between these disorders. METHODS: Families were
      ascertained through a proband with CM-I. Detailed family histories were obtained 
      to identify first-degree relatives diagnosed with CM-0. Several criteria were
      used to exclude individuals with acquired forms of CM-I and/or syringomyelia.
      Individuals were excluded with syndromic, traumatic, infectious, or tumor-related
      syringomyelia, as well as CM-I due to a supratentorial mass, hydrocephalus,
      history of cervical or cranial surgery unrelated to CM-I, or development of
      symptoms following placement of a lumbar shunt. Medical records and MR images
      were used to characterize CM-I and CM-0 individuals clinically and
      radiologically. RESULTS: Five families were identified in which the CM-I proband 
      had a first-degree relative with CM-0. Further assessment of affected individuals
      showed similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I
      individuals, although CM-I patients in general had more severe symptoms and skull
      base abnormalities than their CM-0 relatives. Overall, both groups showed
      improvement in symptoms and/or syrinx size following craniocervical decompression
      surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There is accumulating evidence suggesting that CM-0 and
      CM-I may be caused by a common underlying developmental mechanism. The data in
      this study are consistent with this hypothesis, showing similar clinical and
      radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, as well as the
      occurrence of both disorders within families. Familial clustering of CM-0 and
      CM-I suggests that these disorders may share an underlying genetic basis,
      although additional epigenetic and/or environmental factors are likely to play an
      important role in the development of CM-0 versus CM-I.

TI  - Top dermatologic conditions in patients of color: an analysis of nationally
      representative data.
PG  - 466-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some dermatologic disorders are known to be much more common in
      patients of color, but the leading dermatologic disorders in patients of color
      have not yet been described on the basis of nationally representative data.
      PURPOSE: To determine the leading dermatologic disorders for each major racial
      and ethnic group in the United States. METHODS: We queried the National
      Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for the leading diagnoses in patient
      visits to U.S. dermatologists from 1993 to 2009. The leading diagnoses were
      tabulated for each racial and ethnic group, and the top conditions were compared 
      between groups. In a separate analysis, visits for skin conditions regardless of 
      physician specialty were analyzed for leading diagnoses in each racial and ethnic
      group. RESULTS: The top five diagnoses for African-American patients in
      dermatology clinics were acne, unspecified dermatitis or eczema, seborrheic
      dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and dyschromia. For Asian or Pacific Islander
      patients, the top five were acne, unspecified dermatitis or eczema, benign
      neoplasm of skin, psoriasis, and seborrheic keratosis. By contrast, in Caucasian 
      patients, the top five were actinic keratosis, acne, benign neoplasm of skin,
      unspecified dermatitis or eczema, and nonmelanoma skin cancer. In Hispanic
      patients of any race, the leading diagnoses were acne, unspecified dermatitis or 
      eczema, psoriasis, benign neoplasm of skin, and viral warts. When the leading
      dermatologic diagnoses across all physician specialties were assessed, the top
      diagnoses for African-Americans were unspecified dermatitis or eczema, acne,
      dermatophytosis of scalp and beard, sebaceous cyst, and cellulitis or abscess;
      for Asians or Pacific Islanders were unspecified dermatitis or eczema, acne,
      atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and psoriasis; and for Caucasians were acne,
      unspecified dermatitis or eczema, actinic keratosis, viral warts, and sebaceous
      cyst. For Hispanics of any race, they were unspecified dermatitis or eczema,
      acne, sebaceous cyst, viral warts, and cellulitis or abscess. For a sole
      diagnosis of a dermatologic condition, only 28.5% of African-Americans' visits
      and 23.9% of Hispanics' visits were to dermatologists, as compared to 36.7% for
      Asians and Pacific Islanders and 43.2% for Caucasians. LIMITATIONS: The data are 
      based on numbers of ambulatory care visits rather than numbers of patients. Data 
      on race or ethnicity were not collected for some patients. CONCLUSIONS: Several
      dermatologic disorders are much more commonly seen in patients of color. Acne and
      unspecified dermatitis or eczema are in the top five for all major U.S. racial
      and ethnic groups. There may be an opportunity to improve the care of patients of
      color by ensuring they have equal access to dermatologists.

TI  - Prenatal isolated mild ventriculomegaly is associated with persistent ventricle
      enlargement at ages 1 and 2.
PG  - 691-8
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2012.02.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enlargement of the lateral ventricles is thought to originate from
      abnormal prenatal brain development and is associated with neurodevelopmental
      disorders. Fetal isolated mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) is associated with the
      enlargement of lateral ventricle volumes in the neonatal period and developmental
      delays in early childhood. However, little is known about postnatal brain
      development in these children. METHODS: Twenty-eight children with fetal isolated
      MVM and 56 matched controls were followed at ages 1 and 2 years with structural
      imaging on a 3T Siemens scanner and assessment of cognitive development with the 
      Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Lateral ventricle, total gray and white matter
      volumes, and Mullen cognitive composite scores and subscale scores were compared 
      between groups. RESULTS: Compared to controls, children with prenatal isolated
      MVM had significantly larger lateral ventricle volumes at ages 1 and 2 years.
      Lateral ventricle volume at 1 and 2 years of age was significantly correlated
      with prenatal ventricle size. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles was
      associated with increased intracranial volumes and increased gray and white
      matter volumes. Children with MVM had Mullen composite scores similar to
      controls, although there was evidence of delay in fine motor and expressive
      language skills. CONCLUSIONS: Children with prenatal MVM have persistent
      enlargement of the lateral ventricles through the age of 2 years; this
      enlargement is associated with increased gray and white matter volumes and some
      evidence of delay in fine motor and expressive language development. Further
      study is needed to determine if enlarged lateral ventricles are associated with
      increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - Patient-reported treatment burden of chronic immune thrombocytopenia therapies.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1471-2326-12-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a debilitating autoimmune
      disorder that causes a reduction in blood platelets and increased risk of
      bleeding. ITP is currently managed with various pharmacologic therapies and
      splenectomy.This study was conducted to assess patient perceived and reported
      treatment side effects, as well as the perceived burden or bother, and need to
      reduce or stop treatment, associated with these side effects among adult patients
      with chronic ITP. METHODS: A Web-enabled survey was administered to members of a 
      US-based ITP patient support group. Patients reported demographic and clinical
      characteristics, ITP treatments' side effects for treatments received since
      diagnosed, level of bother (or distress), and need to reduce or stop treatment,
      associated with side effects. Current and past exposure was assessed for five
      specific treatment types: corticosteroids (CS), intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIg), anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D), rituximab (RT), and splenectomy (SPL), as
      well as for other patient-referenced therapies (captured as "other"). RESULTS:
      The survey was completed by 589 patients; 78% female, 89% white, mean age 48
      years (SD = 14.71), and 68% reported a typical low platelet count of <
      50,000/muL. Current or past treatment with CS was reported by 92% (n = 542) of
      patients, 56% (n = 322) for IVIg, 36% (n = 209) for anti-D, 36% (n = 213) for RT,
      and 39% (n = 227) for SPL. A substantial proportion of CS-treated patients
      reported side effects (98%, P < 0.05), were highly bothered by their side effects
      (53.1%, P < 0.05), and reported the need to stop or reduce treatment due to side 
      effects (37.8%, P < 0.05). Among patients reporting side effects of treatment,
      significant associations were noted for the number of side effects, aggregate
      bother of reported side effects, and the need to stop or reduce treatment (all P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Current ITP treatments, particularly corticosteroids, are
      associated with multiple bothersome side effects that may lead to patients
      stopping or reducing therapy. Open, informed and complete communication between
      clinician and patient regarding both the benefits and the side effects of ITP
      treatment may better prepare patients for their prescribed regimens.

PG  - 228-32
LID - 10.1001/archdermatol.2011.1331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare disease of
      uncertain etiology that most commonly presents as a papulonodular cutaneous
      eruption accompanied by erosive polyarthritis. Although MRH is considered a
      systemic disorder in that it targets skin and joints, involvement of thoracic and
      visceral organs is uncommon. OBSERVATIONS: A woman presented with diffuse
      cutaneous nodules, and skin biopsy findings revealed classic features of MRH.
      However, she also manifested severe pulmonary symptoms. A lung biopsy specimen
      showed prominent histiocytic infiltrates exhibiting the same characteristic
      morphologic features as those seen in her skin. Furthermore, the lung biopsy
      findings were significant for a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia
      accompanied by notable lymphoid aggregates, a pattern of interstitial lung
      disease typical of systemic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings are notable because a histiocytic pulmonary infiltrate suggestive 
      of direct pulmonary involvement by MRH is a rare event. In addition, presentation
      of MRH in the setting of usual interstitial pneumonia is unique. These
      observations document a new clinical and histopathologic presentation of MRH that
      is significant for expanding the idea of MRH as a systemic disease while
      supporting the notion that MRH is promoted by an inflammatory milieu.

TI  - Exploiting metabolic differences in glioma therapy.
PG  - 280-93
AB  - Brain function depends upon complex metabolic interactions amongst only a few
      different cell types, with astrocytes providing critical support for neurons.
      Astrocyte functions include buffering the extracellular space, providing
      substrates to neurons, interchanging glutamate and glutamine for synaptic
      transmission with neurons, and facilitating access to blood vessels. Whereas
      neurons possess highly oxidative metabolism and easily succumb to ischemia,
      astrocytes rely more on glycolysis and metabolism associated with synthesis of
      critical intermediates, hence are less susceptible to lack of oxygen. Astrocytoma
      and higher grade glioma cells demonstrate both basic metabolic mechanisms of
      astrocytes as well as tumors in general, e.g. they show a high glycolytic rate,
      lactate extrusion, ability to proliferate even under hypoxia, and opportunistic
      use of mechanisms to enhance metabolism and blood vessel generation, and
      suppression of cell death pathways. There may be differences in metabolism
      between neurons, normal astrocytes and astrocytoma cells, providing therapeutic
      opportunities against astrocytomas, including a wide range of enzyme and
      transporter differences, regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), glutamate 
      uptake transporters and glutamine utilization, differential sensitivities of
      monocarboxylate transporters, presence of glycogen, high interlinking with gap
      junctions, use of NADPH for lipid synthesis, utilizing differential regulation of
      synthetic enzymes (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate 
      dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate-aspartate NADH shuttle) and
      different glucose uptake mechanisms. These unique metabolic susceptibilities may 
      augment conventional therapeutic attacks based on cell division differences and
      surface receptors alone, and are starting to be implemented in clinical trials.

TI  - Stopping cancer in its tracks: using small molecular inhibitors to target
      glioblastoma migrating cells.
PG  - 294-304
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents one of the most common aggressive types 
      of primary brain tumors. Despite advances in surgical resection, novel
      neuroimaging procedures, and the most recent adjuvant radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy, the median survival after diagnosis is about 12-14 months.
      Targeting migrating GBM cells is a key research strategy in the fight against
      this devastating cancer. Though the vast majority of the primary tumor focus can 
      be surgically resected, these migrating cells are responsible for its universal
      recurrence. Numerous strategies and technologies are being explored to target
      migrating glioma cells, with small molecular inhibitors as one of the most
      commonly studied. Small molecule inhibitors, such as protein kinase inhibitors,
      phosphorylation site inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and antisense
      oligonucleotides show promise in slowing the progression of this disease. A
      better understanding of these small molecule inhibitors and how they target
      various extra- and intracellular signaling pathways may eventually lead to a cure
      for GBM.

AB  - Malignant glioma remains a disease with poor prognosis despite recent advances in
      the multidisciplinary care of this disease. Herein we review the evolution of and
      recent advances in radiation therapy for malignant glioma that have allowed for
      more targeted therapy, potentially improving efficacy while decreasing normal
      tissue toxicity. Current and emerging techniques are presented, including
      stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery, brachytherapy, radioimmunotherapy,
      and charged particle therapy, as well as the combination of these modalities with
      novel targeted biochemotherapies.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided malignant glioma resections.
PG  - 256-67
AB  - Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and result in dismal outcomes
      when present at high grades. Surgery is the first-line treatment, and maximum
      safe resection is recommended. However, the infiltrative nature of malignant
      gliomas makes complete resection difficult as tumor margins are unclear. The use 
      of fluorescence to delineate tumor margins intraoperatively has emerged as a safe
      and effective tool for increasing the extent of resection. This review discusses 
      several exogenous agents that have been investigated in humans. Aminolevulinic
      acid is the most studied fluorophore and has been used in many clinical trials,
      including a multi-center phase III randomized controlled trial. It has been shown
      to increase extent of resection, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
      Another fluorophore, fluorescein, has also demonstrated utility in increasing
      resection quality and overall survival. Developing technologies such as
      fluorescence spectroscopy to enhance endogenous fluorescence has fairly recently 
      been shown to delineate tumor margins intraoperatively. This method does not
      require the administration of exogenous agents, but instead distinguishes tumor
      from normal brain by using changes in the fluorescence emission profile of the
      tissue. This review also discusses various agents such as nanoparticles that are 
      currently in preclinical testing. Fluorescence-guided resections show great
      promise for furthering our surgical abilities, and in the foreseeable future will
      become the standard of care for patients diagnosed with gliomas.

AB  - With an average life expectancy of 14 months, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is
      the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Our growing understanding of the immune 
      system and its role in oncogenesis has helped develop cancer vaccines as a
      promising treatment modality against this disease. What follows is a
      comprehensive discussion on the history of immunotherapy and the various vaccine 
      based therapies being developed and utilized for the treatment of malignant
      gliomas.

TI  - SHP-2 acts via ROCK to regulate the cardiac actin cytoskeleton.
PG  - 948-57
LID - 10.1242/dev.067579 [doi]
AB  - Noonan syndrome is one of the most common causes of human congenital heart
      disease and is frequently associated with missense mutations in the protein
      phosphatase SHP-2. Interestingly, patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and
      LEOPARD syndrome frequently carry a second, somatically introduced subset of
      missense mutations in SHP-2. To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms
      by which SHP-2 regulates heart development and, thus, understand how
      Noonan-associated mutations affect cardiogenesis, we introduced SHP-2 encoding
      the most prevalent Noonan syndrome and JMML mutations into Xenopus embryos.
      Resulting embryos show a direct relationship between a Noonan SHP-2 mutation and 
      its ability to cause cardiac defects in Xenopus; embryos expressing Noonan SHP-2 
      mutations exhibit morphologically abnormal hearts, whereas those expressing an
      SHP-2 JMML-associated mutation do not. Our studies indicate that the cardiac
      defects associated with the introduction of the Noonan-associated SHP-2 mutations
      are coupled with a delay or arrest of the cardiac cell cycle in M-phase and a
      failure of cardiomyocyte progenitors to incorporate into the developing heart. We
      show that these defects are a result of an underlying malformation in the
      formation and polarity of cardiac actin fibers and F-actin deposition. We show
      that these defects can be rescued in culture and in embryos through the
      inhibition of the Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK),
      thus demonstrating a direct relationship between SHP-2(N308D) and ROCK activation
      in the developing heart.

PG  - 1530-4

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a thrombotic
      microangiopathy, is a clinical diagnosis, characterized by microangiopathic
      hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without another likely explanation. Some
      initiators of the disease are well represented in the literature, such as certain
      drugs, malignancies, and viral illness; however, there are less objective factors
      still being investigated, with references to hormonal, stress, and seasonal
      variations considered anecdotally. A better insight of these factors would aid in
      understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective review of all idiopathic TTP cases treated with
      therapeutic plasma exchange at our institution from 1999 to 2008 to determine
      whether there was seasonal variation in TTP presentation. Seasons were defined as
      follows: winter = December to February; spring = March to May; summer = June to
      August; and fall = September to November. With the use of Poisson regression
      models, the incidence between seasons was compared. RESULTS: During this study
      period, a total of 97 cases were recorded. Summer had the highest occurrence of
      TTP (35%). This was significant compared to the fall (p = 0.012) and the winter
      (p = 0.019). There were more cases in the summer compared to the spring, but this
      was not significant. CONCLUSION: In our population, there was a significant
      difference in the number of TTP cases presenting in summer compared to fall and
      winter. This supports a possible environmental, infectious, or physiologic
      influence associated with the summer.

      (MTBE) in Wistar rats.
PG  - 593-606
LID - 10.1002/jat.1776 [doi]
AB  - Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) has been used as a gasoline additive to reduce
      tailpipe emissions and its use has been discontinued. There remains a concern
      that drinking water sources have been contaminated with MTBE. A two-year drinking
      water carcinogenicity study of MTBE was conducted in Wistar rats (males, 0, 0.5, 
      3, 7.5 mg ml(-1); and females, 0, 0.5, 3, and 15 mg ml(-1)). Body weights were
      unaffected and water consumption was reduced in MTBE-exposed males and females.
      Wet weights of male kidneys were increased at the end of two years of exposure to
      7.5 mg ml(-1) MTBE. Chronic progressive nephropathy was observed in males and
      females, was more severe in males, and was exacerbated in the high MTBE exposure 
      groups. Brain was the only tissue with a statistically significant finding of
      neoplasms. One astrocytoma (1/50) was found in a female rat (15 mg ml(-1)). The
      incidence of brain astrocytomas in male rats was 1/50, 1/50, 1/50 and 4/50 for
      the 0, 0.5, 3 and 7.5 mg ml(-1) exposure groups, respectively. This was a
      marginally significant statistical trend, but not statistically significant when 
      pairwise comparisons were made or when multiple comparisons were taken into
      account. The incidence of astrocytoma fell within historical control ranges for
      Wistar rats, and the brain has not been identified as a target organ following
      chronic administration of MTBE, ethyl tert-butyl ether, or tertiary butyl alcohol
      (in drinking water) to mice and rats. We conclude that the astrocytomas observed 
      in this study are not associated with exposure to MTBE.

PG  - 370-4
LID - 10.1016/j.amjoto.2011.10.006 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Jugular foramen lesions are often associated with pathology of
      adjacent structures due to either compression or direct invasion. Common
      presenting symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, a neck mass, hearing loss, and
      cranial nerve palsies, leading to changes in taste, vocal cord paralysis,
      dysphagia, and sternocleidomastoid/trapezius weakness (A. Hakuba, K. Hashi, K.
      Fujitani, et al., Jugular foramen neurinomas. Surg Neurol 1979; 11:83-94). This
      patient was found to have a jugular foramen mass after presenting with the
      unusual constellation of visual changes and headache. CASE PRESENTATION: A
      jugular foramen mass in a young woman was discovered after presenting with visual
      changes and headache; the patient was found to have papilledema on initial
      examination. Otologic and head and neck examination were normal. Subsequent
      imaging demonstrated a mass at the right jugular foramen with compression of this
      structure; a contralateral transverse sinus stenosis was also seen. This latter
      abnormality (along with obstruction of the jugular foramen) impeded venous
      drainage leading to papilledema and visual changes. DISCUSSION: In a patient
      presenting with papilledema and severe headache with an associated jugular
      foramen mass, a multidisciplinary approach benefits the patient with input from
      interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and neuro-ophthalmology. Venous
      outflow was compromised through the left stenotic transverse sinus, and the
      normal outflow on the right side through the jugular bulb was impeded by the
      tumor; obstructions of both led to symptomatic impeded venous outflow. This
      compromise in venous outflow led to an increase in superior sagittal sinus
      pressure, with subsequent increase in intracranial pressure and resultant
      papilledema. In an attempt to increase blood flow, an angioplasty was performed
      on the patient's affected transverse sinus. In addition, symptomatology
      consistent with pseudotumor cerebri prompted the use of acetazolamide for medical
      management. After both therapies, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved
      and were stable. The tumor has also remained stable, with no immediate need for
      surgical resection, stereotactic radiation, or consideration of an intraluminal
      transverse sinus stent placement or shunting. CONCLUSION: The unique presentation
      of a jugular foramen mass in a young woman leading to papilledema highlights the 
      need for high clinical suspicion of potential etiologies necessary for diagnosis.
      Despite the benign nature of her disease process, an unusual constellation of
      anatomical factors lead to the need for acute intervention.

AB  - Drug delivery of immunotoxins to brain tumors circumventing the blood brain
      barrier is a significant challenge. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
      circumvents the blood brain barrier through direct intracerebral application
      using a hydrostatic pressure gradient to percolate therapeutic compounds
      throughout the interstitial spaces of infiltrated brain and tumors. The efficacy 
      of CED is determined through the distribution of the therapeutic agent to the
      targeted region. The vast majority of patients fail to receive a significant
      amount of coverage of the area at risk for tumor recurrence. Understanding this
      challenge, it is surprising that so little work has been done to monitor the
      delivery of therapeutic agents using this novel approach. Here we present a
      review of imaging in convection enhanced delivery monitoring of toxins in humans,
      and discuss future challenges in the field.

AB  - Determining radiographic progression in primary malignant brain tumors has posed 
      a significant challenge to the neuroncology community. Glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM, WHO Grade IV) through its inherent heterogeneous enhancement, growth
      patterns, and irregular nature has been difficult to assess for progression. Our 
      ability to detect tumor progression radiographically remains inadequate. Despite 
      the advanced imaging techniques, detecting tumor progression continues to be a
      clinical challenge. Here we review the different criteria used to detect tumor
      progression, and highlight the inherent challenges with detection of progression.

      recurrent glioblastoma.

AB  - We evaluated the efficacy of carboplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab among
      bevacizumab-naive, recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients in a phase 2,
      open-label, single arm trial. Forty eligible patients received carboplatin (area 
      under the plasma curve [AUC] 4 mg/ml-min) on day one, while bevacizumab (10
      mg/kg) and irinotecan (340 mg/m(2) for patients on CYP3A-enzyme-inducing
      anti-epileptics [EIAEDs] and 125 mg/m(2) for patients not on EIAEDs) were
      administered on days 1 and 14 of every 28-day cycle. Patients were evaluated
      after each of the first two cycles and then after every other cycle. Treatment
      continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance, or
      voluntary withdrawal. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6
      months (PFS-6) and secondary endpoints included safety and median overall
      survival (OS). All patients had progression after standard therapy. The median
      age was 51 years. Sixteen patients (40%) had a KPS of 90-100, while 27 (68%) were
      at first progression. The median time from original diagnosis was 11.4 months.
      The PFS-6 rate was 46.5% (95% CI: 30.4, 61.0%) and the median OS was 8.3 months
      [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9, and 10.7 months]. Grade 4 events were
      primarily hematologic and included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 20 and
      10%, respectively. The most common grade 3 events were neutropenia,
      thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and infection in 25, 20, 13, and 10%, respectively.
      Eleven patients (28%) discontinued study therapy due to toxicity and 17 patients 
      (43%) required dose modification. One patient died due to treatment-related
      intestinal perforation. The addition of carboplatin and irinotecan to bevacizumab
      significantly increases toxicity but does not improve anti-tumor activity to that
      achieved historically with single-agent bevacizumab among bevacizumab-naive,
      recurrent GBM patients. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00953121).

PG  - 6-18
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nor141 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Ralpha2) is a glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM)-associated plasma membrane receptor, a brain tumor of dismal prognosis.
      Here, we isolated peptide ligands for IL-13Ralpha2 with use of a cyclic
      disulphide-constrained heptapeptide phages display library and 2 in vitro
      biopanning schemes with GBM cells that do (G26-H2 and SnB19-pcDNA cells) or do
      not (G26-V2 and SnB19-asIL-13Ralpha2 cells) over-express IL-13Ralpha2. We
      identified 3 peptide phages that bind to IL-13Ralpha2 in cellular and protein
      assays. One of the 3 peptide phages, termed Pep-1, bound to IL-13Ralpha2 with the
      highest specificity, surprisingly, also in a reducing environment. Pep-1 was thus
      synthesized and further analyzed in both linear and disulphide-constrained forms.
      The linear peptide bound to IL-13Ralpha2 more avidly than did the
      disulphide-constrained form and was efficiently internalized by
      IL-13Ralpha2-expressing GBM cells. The native ligand, IL-13, did not compete for 
      the Pep-1 binding to the receptor and vice versa in any of the assays, indicating
      that the peptide might be binding to a site on the receptor different from the
      native ligand. Furthermore, we demonstrated by noninvasive near infrared
      fluorescence imaging in nude mice that Pep-1 binds and homes to both subcutaneous
      and orthotopic human GBM xenografts expressing IL-13Ralpha2 when injected by an
      intravenous route. Thus, we identified a linear heptapeptide specific for the
      IL-13Ralpha2 that is capable of crossing the blood-brain tumor barrier and homing
      to tumors. Pep-1 can be further developed for various applications in cancer
      and/or inflammatory diseases.

      OBSERVATIONS: A 3-year-old Caucasian male with a history of ichthyosis since
      birth presented with generalized tonic seizures. Findings from a physical
      examination were remarkable for thin hair, retinitis pigmentosa, and poor
      dentition. Polarized light microscopic examination of all the hair samples
      demonstrated a banding pattern. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed 
      left hemispheric polymicrogyria with decreased sulcal pattern and stable
      asymmetric dilation of the left lateral ventricle. Constitutional microarray
      revealed the typical approximately 1.5-Mb deletion of the steroid sulfatase gene.
      CONCLUSIONS: Steroid sulfatase deficiency is a cause of X-linked ichthyosis;
      however, our patient also had retinitis pigmentosa, seizures, and abnormal hair
      findings. The presence of abnormal hair with a banding pattern on polarized
      microscopy may be helpful for diagnosis; however, this pattern is not specific to
      this disease. In addition, to our knowledge, the presence of a malformation of
      cortical development has not been previously reported in patients with steroid
      sulfatase deficiency.

TI  - Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of n.c.a. iodoquine: a novel radiotracer
      with high uptake in cells with high ALDH1 expression.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - PURPOSE: Chloroquine has demonstrated high affinity for aldehyde dehydrogenase
      1A1 (ALDH1), an enzyme expressed in the highly tumorigenic CD133+ brain tumor
      initiating subpopulation. The purpose of this study is to report the novel
      synthesis of a chloroquine analogue, n.c.a. iodoquine, and the in vitro and in
      vivo uptake in cells with high ALDH1 content. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Iodoquine
      was synthesized in novel no-carrier-added forms (n.c.a.) for both 125I and 123I. 
      I25I IQ and 18F FDG cell uptake assays were performed in the L1210 and L1210cpa
      (cyclophosphamide resistant), A549, and MG456 glioblastoma cell lines. Uptake was
      expressed as a percent of the administered activity. 125I IQ biodistribution
      studies assessed organ uptake at 1, 4, and 24 hours after IV administration (n=
      15 total; 5 mice/timepoint). Radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated using 
      standard OLINDA/EXM software. In vivo imaging of 123I IQ uptake in MG456
      glioblastoma mouse model (n=10) was performed with small animal high resolution
      micro-SPECT. Autoradiography and histology co-localized radiotracer and tumor
      biodistribution. Uptake in MG456 glioblastoma tumors was quantified with gamma
      counting. RESULTS: L1210 cpa (high ALDH1) showed significantly higher 125I IQ
      uptake compared to the parental L1210 (low ALDH1) for all time points through 4
      hours (20.7% +/- 1.4% versus 11.0% +/- 0.5%; 21.3% +/- 0.9% versus 11.0% +/-
      0.4%; 20.6% +/- 0.7% versus 9.4% +/- 0.3%; and 15.7% +/- 0.7% versus 7.5% + 0.4% 
      at 30 minutes, and 1, 2 and 4 hours, respectively; p < 0.001 for all time
      points). In the CD133+ fraction of MG456 glioblastoma cell line, IQ uptake was
      significantly higher compared to FDG at all time points through 4 hours (81.5%
      +/- 0.9% versus 1.3% +/- 0.1%; 88.8% +/- 0.4% versus 1.3% +/- 0.1%; 87.8% +/-
      2.1% versus 1.7% +/- 0.2%; and 87.0% +/- 2.4% versus 1.8% +/- 0.1 at 30 minutes, 
      and 1, 2 and 4 hours, respectively; p > 0.001 for all time points). The A549 lung
      cancer cell line also showed high IQ uptake through 4 hours. IQ normal
      biodistribution studies showed rapid renal excretion and very low normal
      background brain activity after IV administration. In vivo micro-SPECT images
      showed mild uptake in larger MG456 glioblastomas (n=6) as verified with
      autoradiography and histology. Gamma well counter uptake in large tumors was 2.3%
      +/- 0.48% ID/g (n=5). CONCLUSION: Iodoquine localizes to cells with high ALDH1
      content. Cell assays show high 125I IQ uptake in the MG456 cell line, and in vivo
      micro-SPECT imaging showed mild 123I IQ uptake in MG456 glioblastomas. Further
      studies are necessary to investigate 131I IQ as a potential therapeutic agent
      targeting the highly tumorigenic CD133+ brain tumor stem cell subpopulation.

AB  - Current radiologic diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) requires a
      subjective judgment of whether lateral ventricular enlargement is
      disproportionate to cerebral atrophy based on visual inspection of brain images. 
      We investigated whether quantitative measurements of lateral ventricular volume
      and total cortical thickness (a correlate of cerebral atrophy) could be used to
      more objectively distinguish NPH from normal controls (NC), Alzheimer's (AD), and
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Volumetric MRIs were obtained prospectively from
      patients with NPH (n = 5), PD (n = 5), and NC (5). Additional NC (n = 5) and AD
      patients (n = 10) from the ADNI cohort were examined. Although mean ventricular
      volume was significantly greater in the NPH group than all others, the range of
      values overlapped those of the AD group. Individuals with NPH could be better
      distinguished when ventricular volume and total cortical thickness were
      considered in combination. This pilot study suggests that volumetric MRI
      measurements hold promise for improving NPH differential diagnosis.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using 3.5-Fr intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) catheters for minimally-invasive, image-guided hyperthermia
      treatment of tumors in the brain. Feasibility was demonstrated by: (1)
      retro-fitting a commercial 3.5-Fr IVUS catheter with a 5 x 0.5 x 0.22 mm PZT-4
      transducer for 9-MHz imaging and (2) testing an identical transducer for therapy 
      potential with 3.3-MHz continuous-wave excitation. The imaging transducer was
      compared with a 9-Fr, 9-MHz ICE catheter when visualizing the post-mortem ovine
      brain and was also used to attempt vascular access to an in vivo porcine brain. A
      net average electrical power input of 700 mW was applied to the therapy
      transducer, producing a temperature rise of +13.5 degrees C at a depth of 1.5 mm 
      in live brain tumor tissue in the mouse model. These results suggest that it may 
      be feasible to combine the imaging and therapeutic capabilities into a single
      device as a clinically-viable instrument.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Better understanding of aberrantly active molecular pathways in
      tumors offers potential to develop more specific and less toxic therapies.
      Abnormal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex signaling and defects in
      TSC1 and TSC2 have been associated with the development of subependymal giant
      cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Recently,
      mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown encouraging benefit for patients
      with SEGAs. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss a molecular genetic pathway linked
      with TSC, specifically the role of two proteins whose functional absence is
      responsible for most SEGA tumors that arise in TSC patients. The authors also
      examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically
      and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for 
      patients with inoperable SEGAs. EXPERT OPINION: Everolimus (Afinitor) selectively
      targets a molecular defect of SEGAs in TSC patients. Although surgery is
      effective, most SEGAs recur. An agent that inhibits an underlying molecular
      abnormality represents a particularly attractive therapeutic option for patients 
      with inoperable or recurrent tumors. Studies are also underway to assess
      everolimus in treating other sequelae of TSC, and other gliomas. Finally,
      additional research aimed at better understanding aberrant cell signaling
      pathways may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics.

TI  - Monoclonal antibody blockade of IL-2 receptor alpha during lymphopenia
      selectively depletes regulatory T cells in mice and humans.

AB  - Lymphodepletion augments adoptive cell transfer during antitumor immunotherapy,
      producing dramatic clinical responses in patients with malignant melanoma. We
      report that the lymphopenia induced by the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide
      (TMZ) enhances vaccine-driven immune responses and significantly reduces
      malignant growth in an established model of murine tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly,
      despite the improved antitumor efficacy engendered by TMZ-induced lymphopenia,
      there was a treatment related increase in the frequency of immunosuppressive
      regulatory T cells (T(Regs); P = .0006). Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated
      inhibition of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha/CD25) during
      immunotherapy in normal mice depleted T(Regs) (73% reduction; P = .0154) but also
      abolished vaccine-induced immune responses. However, during lymphodepletion,
      IL-2Ralpha blockade decreased T(Regs) (93% reduction; P = .0001) without
      impairing effector T-cell responses, to augment therapeutic antitumor efficacy
      (66% reduction in tumor growth; P = .0024). Of clinical relevance, we also
      demonstrate that anti-IL-2Ralpha mAb administration during recovery from
      lymphodepletive TMZ in patients with glioblastoma reduced T(Reg) frequency (48%
      reduction; P = .0061) while permitting vaccine-stimulated antitumor effector cell
      expansion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of systemic
      antibody-mediated T(Reg) depletion during lymphopenia and the consequent
      synergistic enhancement of vaccine-driven cellular responses, as well as the
      first demonstration that anti-IL-2Ralpha mAbs function differentially in
      nonlymphopenic versus lymphopenic contexts.

TI  - Leptomeningeal melanocytosis in an adult male without large congenital nevi: a
      rare and atypical case of neurocutaneous melanosis.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Leptomeningeal melanocytosis is a primary melanocytic lesion of the central
      nervous system that is characterized by diffuse melanocytic infiltration of the
      leptomeninges. It is seen almost exclusively in children with large congenital
      nevi and together the findings form a dermatologic syndrome known as
      neurocutaneous melanosis. We report a rare and atypical case of a 31-year-old
      adult male with no evident congenital melanocytic lesions who presented with
      neurologic symptoms and was found to have leptomeningeal melanocytosis. The brain
      biopsy demonstrated a conspicuous but benign-appearing melanocytic infiltrate
      that was discordant with the severity of the patient's symptoms. Ultimately, the 
      patient was suspected to represent a case of former fruste neurocutaneous
      melanosis. Herein the relevant clinical and histopathologic features are
      discussed along with a brief review of the literature.

TI  - Duloxetine, pregabalin, and duloxetine plus gabapentin for diabetic peripheral
      neuropathic pain management in patients with inadequate pain response to
      gabapentin: an open-label, randomized, noninferiority comparison.
PG  - 615-26
LID - 10.4065/mcp.2010.0681 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether duloxetine is noninferior to (as good as)
      pregabalin in the treatment of pain associated with diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a 12-week, open-label study of
      patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain who had been treated with
      gabapentin (>/= 900 mg/d) and had an inadequate response (defined as a daily pain
      score of >/= 4 on a numerical rating scale [0-10 points]). The first patient was 
      enrolled on September 28, 2006, and the last patient visit occurred on August 26,
      2009. Patients were randomized to duloxetine monotherapy (n=138), pregabalin
      monotherapy (n=134), or a combination of duloxetine and gabapentin (n=135). The
      primary objective was a noninferiority comparison between duloxetine and
      pregabalin on improvement in the weekly mean of the diary-based daily pain score 
      (0- to 10-point scale) at end point. Noninferiority would be declared if the mean
      improvement for duloxetine was no worse than the mean improvement for pregabalin,
      within statistical variability, by a margin of -0.8 unit. RESULTS: The mean
      change in the pain rating at end point was -2.6 for duloxetine and -2.1 for
      pregabalin. The 97.5% lower confidence limit was a -0.05 difference in means,
      establishing noninferiority. As to adverse effects, nausea, insomnia,
      hyperhidrosis, and decreased appetite were more frequent with duloxetine than
      pregabalin; insomnia, more frequent with duloxetine than duloxetine plus
      gabapentin; peripheral edema, more frequent with pregabalin than with duloxetine;
      and nausea, hyperhidrosis, decreased appetite, and vomiting, more frequent with
      duloxetine plus gabapentin than with pregabalin. CONCLUSION: Duloxetine was
      noninferior to pregabalin for the treatment of pain in patients with diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy who had an inadequate pain response to gabapentin. TRIAL

TI  - Outcomes of plastic closure in gastroschisis.
PG  - 177-85
LID - 10.1016/j.surg.2011.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect in which the
      intestines develop outside the abdomen and are exposed to amniotic fluid. When
      the defect is small, lymphatic, venous, and intestinal obstruction may occur and 
      contribute to the formation of intestinal edema, atresia, ischemia, and a thick
      inflammatory peel. Treatment requires early coverage of abdominal contents either
      by primary closure or by the placement of temporary Silastic silo followed by
      abdominal wall closure. Currently, both traditional suture closure and the
      sutureless plastic closure are being employed to repair the gastroschisis defect.
      The goal of the current study is to evaluate plastic closure. We predict no
      difference will be found in clinical outcomes between plastic closure and
      traditional suture closure. METHODS: A retrospective review of 80 patients
      treated between 2000 and 2009 was performed. Plastic closure was used in 52 (65%)
      and traditional suture closure in 28 (35%) babies. The surgical procedure was
      determined by surgeon preference. Of the 31(39%) babies who required silos, 15
      (19%) were treated with plastic closure and 16 (20%) underwent traditional
      closure. We collected the following demographic data and clinical progression
      data. Using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), we conducted linear
      regression, logistic regression, and time to event models to compare the
      following outcomes: days on ventilator, days to start enteral feeds, days to
      reach goal enteral feeds, days on total parenteral nutrition, hospital charges,
      duration of stay, mortality, and complications. RESULTS: The mean duration of
      follow-up was 11.4 months. Patients spent an average of 6 days on the ventilator.
      There were 2 mortalities. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that no
      differences were found between the 2 closures with most of the outcomes; however,
      when compared with traditional suture closure, those babies treated with plastic 
      closure spent 4 days fewer days on the ventilator (P < .01). Those babies who
      underwent suture closure were more likely to have an infection or sepsis (odds
      ratio, 5.15; P < .001). When the entire cohort was considered, no significant
      difference was found between plastic and suture closure in time to start feeds,
      time to reach goal feeds, time on parenteral nutrition, hospital charges,
      duration of stay, or complications. Ventral hernias were noted in 46 (58%)
      patients, 32 (62%) after plastic closure and 14 (50%) after suture closure (P =
      .32). Hernia repair was required in 16 (20%) patients, 11 (21%) after plastic
      closure, and 5 (18%) after traditional repair (P = .32). In the silo cohort,
      children treated with plastic closure required 7.5(P < .01) fewer days to start
      enteral feeds than those treated with suture closure. CONCLUSION: Plastic closure
      of abdominal wall defects in gastroschisis is effective both as a primary
      procedure and after silo placement. A multivariate analysis shows plastic closure
      to be associated with fewer days of mechanical ventilation and less likelihood of
      developing infection or sepsis.

TI  - Severe lung fibrosis requires an invasive fibroblast phenotype regulated by
      hyaluronan and CD44.
PG  - 1459-71
LID - 10.1084/jem.20102510 [doi]
AB  - Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) is a terminal illness characterized by unremitting matrix deposition in the
      lung. The mechanisms that control progressive fibrosis are unknown.
      Myofibroblasts accumulate at sites of tissue remodeling and produce extracellular
      matrix components such as collagen and hyaluronan (HA) that ultimately compromise
      organ function. We found that targeted overexpression of HAS2 (HA synthase 2) by 
      myofibroblasts produced an aggressive phenotype leading to severe lung fibrosis
      and death after bleomycin-induced injury. Fibroblasts isolated from transgenic
      mice overexpressing HAS2 showed a greater capacity to invade matrix. Conditional 
      deletion of HAS2 in mesenchymal cells abrogated the invasive fibroblast
      phenotype, impeded myofibroblast accumulation, and inhibited the development of
      lung fibrosis. Both the invasive phenotype and the progressive fibrosis were
      inhibited in the absence of CD44. Treatment with a blocking antibody to CD44
      reduced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. Finally, fibroblasts isolated from
      patients with IPF exhibited an invasive phenotype that was also dependent on HAS2
      and CD44. Understanding the mechanisms leading to an invasive fibroblast
      phenotype could lead to novel approaches to the treatment of disorders
      characterized by severe tissue fibrosis.

TI  - Toxicity of gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of intracranial tumors in
      patients with collagen vascular diseases or multiple sclerosis.
PG  - e519-24
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.056 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess toxicity in patients with either a collagen vascular disease
      (CVD) or multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with intracranial radiosurgery. METHODS 
      AND MATERIALS: Between January 2004 and April 2009, 6 patients with MS and 14
      patients with a CVD were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for
      intracranial tumors. Treated lesions included 15 total brain metastases in 7
      patients, 11 benign brain tumors, 1 low grade glioma, and 1 cavernous
      malformation. Toxicities were graded by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
      Acute/Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. "Rare toxicities" were
      characterized as those reported in the scientific literature at an incidence of
      <5%. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 16 months. Median dose to the tumor
      margin was 13.0 Gy (range, 12-21 Gy). Median size of tumor was 5.0 cm(3) (range, 
      0.14-7.8 cm(3)). Of the 14 patients with CVD, none experienced a Grade 3 or 4
      toxicity or a toxicity characterized as rare. Of the 6 patients with MS, 3
      experienced rare toxicities, and two of these were Grade 3 toxicities. Rare
      complications included a patient experiencing both communicating hydrocephalus
      and facial nerve palsy, as well as 2 additional patients with motor cranial nerve
      palsy. High-grade toxicities included the patient with an acoustic neuroma
      requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus, and
      1 patient with a facial nerve schwannoma who experienced permanent facial nerve
      palsy. Interval between radiosurgery and high-grade toxicities ranged from 1 week
      to 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our series suggests that patients with MS who receive
      GKRS may be at increased risk of rare and high-grade treatment-related toxicity. 
      Given the time course of toxicity, treatment-related edema or demyelination
      represent potential mechanisms.

TI  - Pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CAPACITY): two
      randomised trials.
PG  - 1760-9
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60405-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal lung disease
      with inevitable loss of lung function. The CAPACITY programme (studies 004 and
      006) was designed to confirm the results of a phase 2 study that suggested that
      pirfenidone, a novel antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory drug, reduces
      deterioration in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
      METHODS: In two concurrent trials (004 and 006), patients (aged 40-80 years) with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to oral pirfenidone or
      placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks in 110 centres in Australia, Europe, and North 
      America. In study 004, patients were assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to pirfenidone
      2403 mg/day, pirfenidone 1197 mg/day, or placebo; in study 006, patients were
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo. The randomisation 
      code (permuted block design) was computer generated and stratified by region. All
      study personnel were masked to treatment group assignment until after final
      database lock. Treatments were administered orally, 801 mg or 399 mg three times 
      a day. The primary endpoint was change in percentage predicted forced vital
      capacity (FVC) at week 72. Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00287729 and NCT00287716.
      FINDINGS: In study 004, 174 of 435 patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403
      mg/day, 87 to pirfenidone 1197 mg/day, and 174 to placebo. In study 006, 171 of
      344 patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, and 173 to placebo. All
      patients in both studies were analysed. In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline
      in FVC (p=0.001). Mean FVC change at week 72 was -8.0% (SD 16.5) in the
      pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and -12.4% (18.5) in the placebo group (difference 
      4.4%, 95% CI 0.7 to 9.1); 35 (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients,
      respectively, had a decline of at least 10%. A significant treatment effect was
      noted at all timepoints from week 24 and in an analysis over all study timepoints
      (p=0.0007). Mean change in percentage FVC in the pirfenidone 1197 mg/day group
      was intermediate to that in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and placebo groups. In
      study 006, the difference between groups in FVC change at week 72 was not
      significant (p=0.501). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was -9.0% (SD 19.6) in the
      pirfenidone group and -9.6% (19.1) in the placebo group, and the difference
      between groups in predicted FVC change at week 72 was not significant (0.6%, -3.5
      to 4.7); however, a consistent pirfenidone effect was apparent until week 48
      (p=0.005) and in an analysis of all study timepoints (p=0.007). Patients in the
      pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group had higher incidences of nausea (125 [36%] of 345
      vs 60 [17%] of 347), dyspepsia (66 [19%] vs 26 [7%]), vomiting (47 [14%] vs 15
      [4%]), anorexia (37 [11%] vs 13 [4%]), photosensitivity (42 [12%] vs 6 [2%]),
      rash (111 [32%] vs 40 [12%]), and dizziness (63 [18%] vs 35 [10%]) than did those
      in the placebo group. Fewer overall deaths (19 [6%] vs 29 [8%]) and fewer deaths 
      related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (12 [3%] vs 25 [7%]) occurred in the
      pirfenidone 2403 mg/day groups than in the placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: The
      data show pirfenidone has a favourable benefit risk profile and represents an
      appropriate treatment option for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - A functional thymus develops after cultured thymus tissue is transplanted into
      subjects with complete DiGeorge anomaly. To gain insight into how the process
      occurs, 7 post-transplantation thymus biopsy tissues were evaluated. In 5 of 7
      biopsies, the thymus appeared to be predominantly cortex with thymocytes
      expressing cortical markers. Unexpectedly, the epithelium expressed both cortical
      [cortical dendritic reticulum antigen 2 (CDR2)] and medullary [cytokeratin (CK)
      14] markers. Early medullary development was suggested by epithelial cell
      adhesion molecule (EpCAM) reactivity in small areas of biopsies. Two other
      biopsies had distinct mature cortex and medulla with normal restriction of CK14
      to the medulla and subcapsular cortex, and of CDR2 to cortex. These data are
      consistent with a model in which thymic epithelium contains CK14+ "progenitor
      epithelial cells". After transplantation these cells proliferate as CK14+CDR2+
      thymic epithelial cells that are associated with cortical thymocytes. Later these
      cells differentiate into distinct cortical and medullary epithelia.

LID - 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_4 [doi]
AB  - The physiological relevance of the purinergic signaling network for airway
      defenses is emerging through cumulating reports of abnormal ATP and adenosine
      (ADO) levels in the airway secretions of patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary 
      obstructive diseases, cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The
      consequences for airway defenses range from abnormal clearance responses to the
      destruction of lung tissue by excessive inflammation. This chapter reviews the
      challenges of assessing airway purines in human subjects, and identifies the
      general trend in aberrant airway composition. Most diseases are associated with
      an accumulation of ATP and/or ADO in bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum or exhaled
      breadth condensate. Intriguing is the case of cystic fibrosis patients, which do 
      not accumulate airway ADO, but its precursor, AMP. This observation launched the 
      investigation of ectonucleotidases as target proteins for the correction of
      airway purine levels in chronic respiratory diseases. This chapter exposes the
      extensive rearrangement of the enzymatic network taking place in diseased
      airways, and identifies signaling pathways likely involved in the aberrant
      regulation of the airway purines.

TI  - Induction of tolerance to parental parathyroid grafts using allogeneic thymus
      tissue in patients with DiGeorge anomaly.
PG  - 1351-5

AB  - DiGeorge anomaly can affect both thymic and parathyroid function. Although
      athymia is corrected by allogeneic thymus transplantation, treatment options for 
      hypoparathyroidism have been unsatisfactory. Parathyroid transplantation offers
      the potential for definitive cure but remains challenging because of graft
      rejection. Some allogeneic parathyroid grafts have functioned in adult recipients
      in the context of immunosuppression for renal transplantation. Other efforts have
      attempted to reduce the allogenicity of the parathyroid grafts through
      manipulation of the parathyroid tissues before transplantation (by using
      encapsulation or special culture techniques). Recently, we demonstrated the
      efficacy of parental parathyroid transplantation when combined with allogeneic
      thymus transplantation in an infant with complete DiGeorge anomaly. The recipient
      developed tolerance toward the parathyroid donor. The parathyroid graft has
      functioned for 5 years after transplantation without the need for continued
      immunosuppression or calcium supplementation. We observed that matching of the
      allogeneic thymus graft to the parathyroid donor HLA class II alleles that are
      unshared with the recipient appears to be associated with the induction of
      tolerance toward the parathyroid graft. Further work is needed to determine the
      optimal means for using combined allogeneic thymus and parental parathyroid
      transplantation to correct hypoparathyroidism in patients with both complete and 
      partial DiGeorge anomaly.

TI  - A review of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapeutics for recurrent glioblastoma.
PG  - 414-27
AB  - Glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor among adults, is a
      highly angiogenic and deadly tumor. Angiogenesis in glioblastoma, driven by
      hypoxia-dependent and independent mechanisms, is primarily mediated by vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and generates blood vessels with distinctive
      features. The outcome for patients with recurrent glioblastoma is poor because of
      ineffective therapies. However, recent encouraging rates of radiographic response
      and progression-free survival, and adequate safety, led the FDA to grant
      accelerated approval of bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against
      VEGF, for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in May 2009. These results have
      triggered significant interest in additional antiangiogenic agents and
      therapeutic strategies for patients with both recurrent and newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma. Given the potent antipermeability effect of VEGF inhibitors, the
      Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria were recently implemented
      to better assess response among patients with glioblastoma. Although bevacizumab 
      improves survival and quality of life, eventual tumor progression is the norm.
      Better understanding of resistance mechanisms to VEGF inhibitors and
      identification of effective therapy after bevacizumab progression are currently a
      critical need for patients with glioblastoma.

TI  - Oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus induces apoptosis in U87 glioblastoma cells 
      by a type II death receptor mechanism and induces cell death and tumor clearance 
      in vivo.
PG  - 5708-17
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02393-10 [doi]
AB  - Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a potential oncolytic virus for treating
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor. Matrix (M) protein
      mutants of VSV have shown greater selectivity for killing GBM cells versus normal
      brain cells than VSV with wild-type M protein. The goal of this research was to
      determine the contribution of death receptor and mitochondrial pathways to
      apoptosis induced by an M protein mutant (M51R) VSV in U87 human GBM tumor cells.
      Compared to controls, U87 cells expressing a dominant negative form of Fas
      (dnFas) or overexpressing Bcl-X(L) had reduced caspase-3 activation following
      infection with M51R VSV, indicating that both the death receptor pathway and
      mitochondrial pathways are important for M51R VSV-induced apoptosis. Death
      receptor signaling has been classified as type I or type II, depending on whether
      signaling is independent (type I) or dependent on the mitochondrial pathway (type
      II). Bcl-X(L) overexpression inhibited caspase activation in response to a
      Fas-inducing antibody, similar to the inhibition in response to M51R VSV
      infection, indicating that U87 cells behave as type II cells. Inhibition of
      apoptosis in vitro delayed, but did not prevent, virus-induced cell death. Murine
      xenografts of U87 cells that overexpress Bcl-X(L) regressed with a time course
      similar to that of control cells following treatment with M51R VSV, and tumors
      were not detectable at 21 days postinoculation. Immunohistochemical analysis
      demonstrated similar levels of viral antigen expression but reduced activation of
      caspase-3 following virus treatment of Bcl-X(L)-overexpressing tumors compared to
      controls. Further, the pathological changes in tumors following treatment with
      virus were quite different in the presence versus the absence of Bcl-X(L)
      overexpression. These results demonstrate that M51R VSV efficiently induces
      oncolysis in GBM tumor cells despite deregulation of apoptotic pathways,
      underscoring its potential use as a treatment for GBM.

TI  - DNA methylation-mediated silencing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug-activated gene (NAG-1/GDF15) in glioma cell lines.
PG  - 267-77
LID - 10.1002/ijc.26082 [doi]
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene, NAG-1, a transforming growth 
      factor-beta member, is involved in tumor progression and development. The
      association between NAG-1 expression and development and progression of glioma
      has not been well defined. Glioblastoma cell lines have lower basal expression of
      NAG-1 than other gliomas and normal astrocytes. Most primary human gliomas have
      very low levels of NAG-1 expression. NAG-1 basal expression appeared to inversely
      correlate with tumor grade in glioma. Aberrant promoter hypermethylation is a
      common mechanism for silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. In
      glioblastoma cell lines, NAG-1 expression was increased by the demethylating
      agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. To investigate whether the NAG-1 gene was silenced
      by hypermethylation in glioblastoma, we examined DNA methylation status using
      genomic bisulfite sequencing. The NAG-1 promoter was densely methylated in
      several glioblastoma cell lines as well as in primary oligodendroglioma tumor
      samples, which have low basal expression of NAG-1. DNA methylation at two
      specific sites (-53 and +55 CpG sites) in the NAG-1 promoter was strongly
      associated with low NAG-1 expression. The methylation of the NAG-1 promoter at
      the -53 site blocks Egr-1 binding and thereby suppresses Nag-1 induction.
      Treatment of cells with low basal NAG-1 expression with NAG-1 inducer also did
      not increase NAG-1. Incubation with a demethylation chemical increased Nag-1
      basal expression and subsequent incubation with a NAG-1 inducer increased NAG-1
      expression. We concluded from these data that methylation of specific promoter
      sequences causes transcriptional silencing of the NAG-1 locus in glioma and may
      ultimately contribute to tumor progression.

AB  - Cilengitide, a cyclicized arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-containing pentapeptide,
      potently blocks alphanubeta3 and alphanubeta5 integrin activation. Integrins are 
      upregulated in many malignancies and mediate a wide variety of tumor-stroma
      interactions. Cilengitide and other integrin-targeting therapeutics have
      preclinical activity against many cancer subtypes including glioblastoma (GBM),
      the most common and deadliest CNS tumor. Cilengitide is active against orthotopic
      GBM xenografts and can augment radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these models. In 
      Phase I and II GBM trials, cilengitide and the combination of cilengitide with
      standard temozolomide and radiation demonstrate consistent antitumor activity and
      a favorable safety profile. Cilengitide is currently under evaluation in a
      pivotal, randomized Phase III study (Cilengitide in Combination With Temozolomide
      and Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Phase III Randomized Clinical
      Trial [CENTRIC]) for newly diagnosed GBM. In addition, randomized controlled
      Phase II studies with cilengitide are ongoing for non-small-cell lung cancer and 
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Cilengitide is the first integrin
      inhibitor in clinical Phase III development for oncology.

      architecture and impaired gas exchange. beta-Arrestins regulate G protein
      (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors through
      receptor desensitization while also acting as signaling scaffolds to facilitate
      numerous effector pathways. Here, we examine the role of beta-arrestin1 and
      beta-arrestin2 in the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. In the
      bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis model, loss of either beta-arrestin1 or
      beta-arrestin2 resulted in protection from mortality, inhibition of matrix
      deposition, and protected lung function. Fibrosis was prevented despite preserved
      recruitment of inflammatory cells and fibroblast chemotaxis. However, isolated
      lung fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated beta-arrestin-null mice failed to invade 
      extracellular matrix and displayed altered expression of genes involved in matrix
      production and degradation. Furthermore, knockdown of beta-arrestin2 in
      fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis attenuated the
      invasive phenotype. These data implicate beta-arrestins as mediators of
      fibroblast invasion and the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and as a potential
      target for therapeutic intervention in patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis.

AB  - Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding
      burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is
      characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular
      dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently 
      have platelets--long considered merely effectors of thrombosis--been implicated
      in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A
      growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet
      activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the
      pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only
      do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also
      appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in
      facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute 
      to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that still plague the care of these
      high-risk individuals. An understanding of the role of platelets in critical
      illness also highlights the potential for both the development of risk
      stratification schema and the use of novel, targeted therapies that might alter
      the natural history of sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS. Future studies of
      adenosine, platelet polyphosphates, and the platelet transcriptome/proteome also 
      should add considerably to our ability to unravel the mysteries of the versatile 
      platelet.

TI  - Effect of single vs bilateral lung transplantation on plasma surfactant protein D
      levels in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

LID - S0012-3692(11)60426-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1378/chest.10-2065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum levels of surfactant protein D (SP-D) have been suggested as
      reflecting epithelial damage in acute lung injury, COPD, and idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF). However, little is known about SP-D levels in the setting of lung
      transplantation. METHODS: We examined plasma SP-D levels in 104 subjects from a
      prospective, multicenter cohort study of lung allograft recipients. Plasma SP-D
      was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay prior to transplant and daily
      for 3 days after transplant. RESULTS: Subjects undergoing transplant for IPF had 
      higher baseline SP-D levels (median, 325 ng/mL) compared with subjects with
      cystic fibrosis, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension (median, 100, 80, and 82 ng/mL,
      respectively; P = .0001). Among subjects with IPF undergoing bilateral
      transplant, SP-D levels declined rapidly postoperatively. In contrast, SP-D
      levels in subjects undergoing single lung transplant for IPF remained
      significantly higher than those of bilateral allograft recipients. Among subjects
      undergoing single lung transplant for IPF, the development of primary graft
      dysfunction (PGD) was associated with a subsequent rise in SP-D levels, whereas
      SP-D levels in IPF subjects undergoing bilateral transplant declined, even in the
      presence of grade 3 PGD. Importantly, single lung allograft recipients without
      PGD had higher postoperative SP-D levels than bilateral allograft recipients with
      PGD. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects undergoing lung transplant for IPF have significantly 
      higher baseline plasma SP-D levels compared with those with other diagnoses.
      Plasma SP-D is likely a biomarker of the air-blood barrier integrity in the
      native IPF lung, but may be less useful as a biomarker of PGD after transplant.

PG  - 6-13

AB  - BACKGROUND: After substantial progress on many fronts, one of the remaining
      barriers still opposing the clinical application of xenotransplantation is a
      disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) that is observed in the
      pre-clinical model of porcine-to-primate transplantation. The onset of DIC is
      particularly rapid in recipients of pulmonary xenografts, usually occurring
      within the first days or even hours of reperfusion. METHODS: In this study, we
      describe the results of two porcine-to-baboon transplants utilizing porcine lungs
      depleted of macrophages, deficient in the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene,
      and with the expression of human decay-accelerating factor, a complement
      regulatory protein. RESULTS: In both cases, evidence of DIC was observed within
      48 h of reperfusion, with thrombocytopenia and increases in levels of
      thrombin-antithrombin complex evident in both cases. Depletion of fibrinogen was 
      observed in one graft, whereas elevation of D-dimer levels was observed in the
      other. One graft, which showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates pre-operatively,
      failed within 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that further efforts to
      address the coagulopathy associated with pulmonary xenotransplantation are
      needed. Further, evidence suggests that resident porcine immune cells can play an
      important role in the coagulopathy associated with xenotransplantation.

AB  - A potential advantage of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery versus modified 
      Blalock-Taussig shunt in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure is limitation 
      of diastolic runoff from the systemic to pulmonary circulation. We evaluated
      mesenteric flow patterns and gastrointestinal outcomes following the Norwood
      procedure associated with either shunt type. Patients randomized to a right
      ventricle to pulmonary artery versus modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in the
      Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial at centers
      participating in this ancillary study were eligible for inclusion; those with
      active necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or end-organ dysfunction were excluded.
      Celiac artery flow characteristics and gastrointestinal outcomes were collected
      at discharge. Forty-four patients (five centers) were included. Median age at
      surgery was 5 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 4-8 days]. Median celiac artery
      resistive index (an indicator of resistance to perfusion) was higher in the
      modified Blalock-Taussig shunt group (n = 19) versus the right ventricle to
      pulmonary artery shunt group (n = 25) [1.00 (IQR = 0.84-1.14) vs. 0.82 (IQR =
      0.74-1.00), p = 0.02]. There was no difference in interstage weight gain,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, or feeding intolerance episodes between the groups.
      The celiac artery resistive index was higher in patients with the modified
      Blalock-Taussig shunt versus the right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt but
      was not associated with measured gastrointestinal outcomes.

TI  - Neuronal-astrocyte metabolic interactions: understanding the transition into
      abnormal astrocytoma metabolism.
PG  - 167-76
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e31820e1152 [doi]
AB  - Brain function depends on complex metabolic interactions among only a few
      different cell types, with astrocytes providing critical support for neurons.
      Astrocyte functions include buffering the extracellular space, providing
      substrates to neurons, interchanging glutamate and glutamine for synaptic
      transmission with neurons, and facilitating access to blood vessels. Whereas
      neurons possess highly oxidative metabolism and easily succumb to ischemia,
      astrocytes rely more on glycolytic metabolism and hence are less susceptible
      tolack of oxygen. Astrocytoma cells seem to retain basic metabolic mechanisms of 
      astrocytes; for example, they show a high glycolytic rate, lactate extrusion,
      ability to flourish under hypoxia, and opportunistic use of mechanisms to enhance
      cell division and maintain growth. Differences in metabolism between neurons and 
      astrocytes may also extend to astrocytoma cells, providing therapeutic
      opportunities against astrocytomas, including sensitivity to acetate, a high rate
      of glycolysis and lactate extrusion, glutamate uptake transporters, differential 
      sensitivities of monocarboxylate transporters, presence of glycogen, high
      interlinking with gap junctions, use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      phosphate for lipid synthesis, using different isoforms of synthetic enzymes
      (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate
      dehydrogenase), and different glucose uptake mechanisms. These unique metabolic
      susceptibilities may augment conventional therapeutic attacks based on cell
      division differences and surface receptors alone.

TI  - Early postnatal hypotension is not associated with indicators of white matter
      damage or cerebral palsy in extremely low gestational age newborns.
PG  - 524-34
LID - 10.1038/jp.2010.201 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs),
      relationships between indicators of early postnatal hypotension and cranial
      ultrasound indicators of cerebral white matter damage imaged in the nursery and
      cerebral palsy diagnoses at 24 months follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: The 1041 infants
      in this prospective study were born at <28 weeks gestation, were assessed for
      three indicators of hypotension in the first 24 postnatal hours, had at least one
      set of protocol cranial ultrasound scans and were evaluated with a structured
      neurological exam at 24 months corrected age. Indicators of hypotension included:
      (1) lowest mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the lowest quartile for gestational
      age; (2) treatment with a vasopressor; and (3) blood pressure lability, defined
      as the upper quartile of the difference between each infant's lowest and highest 
      MAP. Outcomes included indicators of cerebral white matter damage, that is,
      moderate/severe ventriculomegaly or an echolucent lesion on cranial ultrasound
      and cerebral palsy diagnoses at 24 months gestation. Logistic regression was used
      to evaluate relationships among hypotension indicators and outcomes, adjusting
      for potential confounders. RESULT: Twenty-one percent of surviving infants had a 
      lowest blood pressure in the lowest quartile for gestational age, 24% were
      treated with vasopressors and 24% had labile blood pressure. Among infants with
      these hypotension indicators, 10% percent developed ventriculomegaly and 7%
      developed an echolucent lesion. At 24 months follow-up, 6% had developed
      quadriparesis, 4% diparesis and 2% hemiparesis. After adjusting for confounders, 
      we found no association between indicators of hypotension, and indicators of
      cerebral white matter damage or a cerebral palsy diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The
      absence of an association between indicators of hypotension and cerebral white
      matter damage and or cerebral palsy suggests that early hypotension may not be
      important in the pathogenesis of brain injury in ELGANs.

TI  - Biological pathway selection through nonlinear dimension reduction.
PG  - 429-44
LID - 10.1093/biostatistics/kxq081 [doi]
AB  - In the analysis of high-throughput biological data, it is often believed that the
      biological units such as genes behave interactively by groups, that is, pathways 
      in our context. It is conceivable that utilization of priorly available pathway
      knowledge would greatly facilitate both interpretation and estimation in
      statistical analysis of such high-dimensional biological data. In this article,
      we propose a 2-step procedure for the purpose of identifying pathways that are
      related to and influence the clinical phenotype. In the first step, a nonlinear
      dimension reduction method is proposed, which permits flexible within-pathway
      gene interactions as well as nonlinear pathway effects on the response. In the
      second step, a regularized model-based pathway ranking and selection procedure is
      developed that is built upon the summary features extracted from the first step. 
      Simulations suggest that the new method performs favorably compared to the
      existing solutions. An analysis of a glioblastoma microarray data finds 4
      pathways that have evidence of support from the biological literature.

TI  - A change in the apparent diffusion coefficient after treatment with bevacizumab
      is associated with decreased survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme.
PG  - 382-9
LID - 10.1259/bjr/24774491 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of
      changes in parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that occur in
      response to treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan in patients with recurrent 
      glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: 15 patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme underwent serial 1.5 T MRI. Axial single-shot echo planar DTI was
      obtained on scans performed 3 days and 1 day prior to and 6 weeks after
      initiation of therapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were registered to whole
      brain contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient recalled and 3D
      fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) image volumes. Anatomic image
      volumes were segmented to isolate regions of interest defined by tumour-related
      enhancement (TRE) and FLAIR signal abnormality (FSA). Mean ADC and mean FA were
      calculated for each region. A Bland-Altman repeatability coefficient was also
      calculated for each parameter based on the two pre-treatment studies. A patient
      was considered to have a change in FA or ADC after therapy if the difference
      between the pre- and post-treatment values was greater than the repeatability
      coefficient for that parameter. Survival was compared using a Cox proportional
      hazard model. RESULTS: DTI detected a change in ADC within FSA after therapy in
      nine patients (five in whom ADC was increased; four in whom it was decreased).
      Patients with a change in ADC within FSA had significantly shorter overall
      survival (p=0.032) and progression free survival (p=0.046) than those with no
      change. CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme treated
      with bevacizumab and irinotecan, a change in ADC after therapy in FSA is
      associated with decreased survival.

      correctable cause. A secondary etiology may be suggested by symptoms (e.g.,
      flushing and sweating suggestive of pheochromocytoma), examina- tion findings
      (e.g., a renal bruit suggestive of renal artery stenosis), or laboratory
      abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia suggestive of aldosteronism). Secondary
      hypertension also should be considered in patients with resistant hyper- tension,
      and early or late onset of hypertension. The prevalence of secondary hypertension
      and the most common etiologies vary by age group. Approximately 5 to 10 percent
      of adults with hypertension have a secondary cause. In young adults, particu-
      larly women, renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dyspla- sia is one of 
      the most common secondary etiologies. Fibromuscular dysplasia can be detected by 
      abdominal magnetic resonance imag- ing or computed tomography. These same imaging
      modalities can be used to detect atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, a major
      cause of secondary hypertension in older adults. In middle-aged adults,
      aldosteronism is the most common secondary cause of hyperten- sion, and the
      recommended initial diagnostic test is an aldosterone/ renin ratio. Up to 85
      percent of children with hypertension have an identifiable cause, most often
      renal parenchymal disease. Therefore, all children with confirmed hypertension
      should have an evaluation for an underlying etiology that includes renal
      ultrasonography.

TI  - Convection-enhanced delivery to achieve widespread distribution of viral vectors:
      Predicting clinical implementation.
PG  - 647-53
AB  - Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been introduced to overcome the inability 
      of many pharmacological agents to cross the blood-brain barrier, making these
      agents potentially effective in situ and suitable for the treatment of brain
      disorders. To achieve CED, drugs are pumped continuously through stereotactically
      placed catheters directly into the brain, or into or within the vicinity of a
      tumor mass. This medical technology has been applied to the local delivery of
      small-molecule drugs, including standard chemotherapeutics, and novel
      experimental targeted drugs, including targeted cytotoxins. When administered by 
      an experienced clinician, the CED of a molecularly targeted cytotoxin has
      resulted in a significantly better outcome in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). More recent gene therapy clinical trials have also
      demonstrated that such treatments impact on the course of the disease when
      administered using CED. The use of CED to administer gene therapy for brain
      neoplasms may improve the efficacy of this treatment. However, CED is under
      development, and issues such as the type of catheters to use and their placement,
      as well as the pharmacological formulation and stability of drugs or vectors, are
      being studied to achieve efficacious delivery into the desired regions of the
      diseased brain. This review discusses the use of CED to deliver gene therapy for 
      brain tumors, particularly gliomas, such as GBM.

TI  - Corticosteroid use in patients with glioblastoma at first or second relapse
      treated with bevacizumab in the BRAIN study.
PG  - 1329-34
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors have
      corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with high-grade gliomas. We assessed
      corticosteroid use in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with
      bevacizumab (BEV) in the BRAIN study (J Clin Oncol 2009;27:4733-4740). METHODS:
      BRAIN was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, noncomparative trial of BEV alone 
      (n = 85) or in combination with irinotecan (CPT-11) (n = 82) in adults with
      recurrent glioblastoma. Median corticosteroid dose for patients who used
      corticosteroids at baseline was summarized by treatment arm; the percentage of
      patients who had sustained (>/=50% corticosteroid dose reduction for >/=50% of
      time on study drug) or complete (discontinuation of corticosteroid for >/=25% of 
      time on study drug) reduction in corticosteroid dose overall and by objective
      response and progression-free survival was calculated. The incidence of
      corticosteroid-related adverse events was summarized. RESULTS: In each treatment 
      group, 50% of patients were using systemic corticosteroids at baseline. The
      majority of those experienced a reduction in dose while receiving BEV-based
      therapy. Thirteen (30.2%) BEV and 20 (46.5%) BEV + CPT-11 patients had a
      sustained reduction of corticosteroid dose; 7 (16.3%) BEV and 9 (20.9%) BEV +
      CPT-11 patients had a complete reduction of corticosteroid dose. The majority of 
      patients who had an objective response or progression-free survival >6 months
      experienced corticosteroid dose reduction. Approximately 64% of patients who used
      corticosteroids while receiving BEV-based therapy experienced infection.
      CONCLUSION: BEV may have corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma. Corticosteroid reduction may positively affect patient
      health-related quality of life. Given the exploratory nature of the analyses in a
      noncomparative study, these results should be interpreted cautiously.

PG  - e1001173

AB  - The structure of immature and mature HIV-1 particles has been analyzed in detail 
      by cryo electron microscopy, while no such studies have been reported for
      cellular HIV-1 budding sites. Here, we established a system for studying HIV-1
      virus-like particle assembly and release by cryo electron tomography of intact
      human cells. The lattice of the structural Gag protein in budding sites was
      indistinguishable from that of the released immature virion, suggesting that its 
      organization is determined at the assembly site without major subsequent
      rearrangements. Besides the immature lattice, a previously not described Gag
      lattice was detected in some budding sites and released particles; this lattice
      was found at high frequencies in a subset of infected T-cells. It displays the
      same hexagonal symmetry and spacing in the MA-CA layer as the immature lattice,
      but lacks density corresponding to NC-RNA-p6. Buds and released particles
      carrying this lattice consistently lacked the viral ribonucleoprotein complex,
      suggesting that they correspond to aberrant products due to premature proteolytic
      activation. We hypothesize that cellular and/or viral factors normally control
      the onset of proteolytic maturation during assembly and release, and that this
      control has been lost in a subset of infected T-cells leading to formation of
      aberrant particles.

PG  - e398-401

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the first successful use of extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to 2009 pH1N1
      influenza A infection in a child status post the Fontan operation for hypoplastic
      left heart syndrome. DESIGN: Individual case report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive
      care unit. PATIENT: We describe a 7-yr-old boy with a history of the Fontan
      operation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome admitted with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome secondary to 2009 pH1N1 influenza A infection. INTERVENTION:
      Cannulation for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: In this patient with a history of complex congenital heart
      disease and repair, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was a successful rescue
      therapy for refractory pH1N1-induced respiratory failure. CONCLUSION:
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be successfully applied for refractory
      respiratory failure, even in the setting of significant underlying comorbidity.
      With emerging data to support the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 
      improving mortality for refractory hypoxemia secondary to pH1N1, it is prudent to
      strongly consider the use of extracorporeal support in patients with underlying
      diseases or comorbidities that may have previously precluded them from being
      candidates for this therapy.

TI  - Integrated genomic analyses identify ERRFI1 and TACC3 as glioblastoma-targeted
      genes.
PG  - 265-77
AB  - The glioblastoma genome displays remarkable chromosomal aberrations, which harbor
      critical glioblastoma-specific genes contributing to several oncogenetic
      pathways. To identify glioblastoma-targeted genes, we completed a multifaceted
      genome-wide analysis to characterize the most significant aberrations of DNA
      content occurring in glioblastomas. We performed copy number analysis of 111
      glioblastomas by Digital Karyotyping and Illumina BeadChip assays and validated
      our findings using data from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) glioblastoma
      project. From this study, we identified recurrent focal copy number alterations
      in 1p36.23 and 4p16.3. Expression analyses of genes located in the two regions
      revealed genes which are dysregulated in glioblastomas. Specifically, we identify
      EGFR negative regulator, ERRFI1, within the minimal region of deletion in
      1p36.23. In glioblastoma cells with a focal deletion of the ERRFI1 locus,
      restoration of ERRFI1 expression slowed cell migration. Furthermore, we
      demonstrate that TACC3, an Aurora-A kinase substrate, on 4p16.3, displays gain of
      copy number, is overexpressed in a glioma-grade-specific pattern, and correlates 
      with Aurora kinase overexpression in glioblastomas. Our multifaceted genomic
      evaluation of glioblastoma establishes ERRFI1 as a potential candidate tumor
      suppressor gene and TACC3 as a potential oncogene, and provides insight on
      targets for oncogenic pathway-based therapy.

AB  - Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) provides important diagnostic information
      for patients with traumatic brain injury. A systematic approach to image
      interpretation optimizes detection of pathologic air, fractures, hemorrhagic
      lesions, brain parenchymal injury, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Bone 
      and brain windows should be reviewed to enhance injury detection. Findings of
      midline shift and mass effect should be noted as well as findings of increased
      intracranial pressure such as hydrocephalus and cerebral edema, because these may
      immediately influence management. Compared with CT, magnetic resonance imaging
      may provide more sensitive detection of diffuse axonal injury but has no proven
      improvement in clinical outcomes. This article discusses key CT interpretation
      skills and reviews important traumatic brain injuries that can be discerned on
      head CT. It focuses on imaging findings that may deserve immediate surgical
      intervention. In addition, the article reviews the limits of noncontrast CT and
      discusses some advanced imaging modalities that may reveal subtle injury patterns
      not seen with CT scan.

TI  - Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) pairing with and transactivation of JunB in GBM
      cells.
PG  - 254-62
AB  - Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) plays an important role in maintenance/progression 
      of various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this study, we
      used both shRNA and siRNA to examine the effect of fra-1 knockdown in GBM cells
      over-expressing Fra-1. Furthermore, we analyzed both the expression of JunB and
      its knockdown, a previously identified target for Fra-1, and also examined its
      potential association with Fra-1. When using fra-1 shRNA and siRNA, we found that
      GBM cells has Fra-1 levels diminished together with the levels of JunB, but Fra-1
      remains unchanged in cells with junB knockdown. This is accompanied by dramatic
      changes in cell morphology and significant alteration in their migration. We next
      uncovered that the expression of JunB increased in response to ectopic Fra-1 and 
      also to EGF-induced signaling, similarly to Fra-1. This was associated with an
      avid pairing between phosphorylated Fra-1 and JunB. Importantly, we found that
      Fra-1 paired with JunB binds to an AP-1 site in the junB gene promoter. JunB
      knockdown did not affect Fra-1 and the changes in cell morphology did not fully
      replicate that seen with Fra-1 knockdown. Thus, Fra-1 takes part in a control of 
      architecture and migratory nature of GBM cells. Moreover, Fra-1 is a
      phosphorylated factor that transactivates JunB with which it makes effectively
      AP-1 pairs in GBM cells.

TI  - Addition of bevacizumab to standard radiation therapy and daily temozolomide is
      associated with minimal toxicity in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.08.058 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the safety of the addition of bevacizumab to standard
      radiation therapy and daily temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 125 patients with newly
      diagnosed GBM were enrolled in the study, and received standard radiation therapy
      and daily temozolomide. All patients underwent a craniotomy and were at least 2
      weeks postoperative. Radiation therapy was administered in 1.8-Gy fractions, with
      the clinical target volume for the primary course treated to a dose of 45 to 50.4
      Gy, followed by a boost of 9 to 14.4 Gy, to a total dose of 59.4 Gy. Patients
      received temozolomide at 75 mg/m(2) daily throughout the course of radiation
      therapy. Bevacizumab was given at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days, beginning
      a minimum of 4 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Of the 125 patients, 120 (96%)
      completed the protocol-specified radiation therapy. Five patients had to stop the
      protocol therapy, 2 patients with pulmonary emboli, and 1 patient each with a
      Grade 2 central nervous system hemorrhage, Grade 4 pancytopenia, and wound
      dehiscence requiring surgical intervention. All 5 patients ultimately finished
      the radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, 3 patients had progressive
      disease, 2 had severe fatigue and decreased performance status, 1 patient had a
      colonic perforation, and 1 had a rectal fissure; these 7 patients therefore did
      not proceed with the protocol-specified adjuvant temozolomide, bevacizumab, and
      irinotecan. However, 113 patients (90%) were able to continue on study.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to standard radiation therapy and daily 
      temozolomide was found to be associated with minimal toxicity in patients newly
      diagnosed with GBM.

AB  - Radiation-induced medulloblastoma is an exceedingly rare phenomenon for which
      treatment standards have not been established. The literature suggests that these
      tumors are high grade with aggressive behavior. We report two cases of
      radiation-induced medulloblastoma which have been treated with full dose
      re-irradiation with curative intent. In both cases, treatment toxicity and tumor 
      progression proved to be insurmountable obstacles. Further reports are necessary 
      in order to fully characterize this clinical entity so that more effective
      therapies may be sought.

TI  - Immunologic escape after prolonged progression-free survival with epidermal
      growth factor receptor variant III peptide vaccination in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma.
PG  - 4722-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.6963 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Immunologic targeting of tumor-specific gene mutations may allow precise
      eradication of neoplastic cells without toxicity. Epidermal growth factor
      receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is a constitutively activated and immunogenic
      mutation not expressed in normal tissues but widely expressed in glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) and other neoplasms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II,
      multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the immunogenicity of an
      EGFRvIII-targeted peptide vaccine and to estimate the progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of vaccinated patients with newly diagnosed
      EGFRvIII-expressing GBM with minimal residual disease. Intradermal vaccinations
      were given until toxicity or tumor progression was observed. Sample size was
      calculated to differentiate between PFS rates of 20% and 40% 6 months after
      vaccination. RESULTS: There were no symptomatic autoimmune reactions. The 6-month
      PFS rate after vaccination was 67% (95% CI, 40% to 83%) and after diagnosis was
      94% (95% CI, 67% to 99%; n = 18). The median OS was 26.0 months (95% CI, 21.0 to 
      47.7 months). After adjustment for age and Karnofsky performance status, the OS
      of vaccinated patients was greater than that observed in a control group matched 
      for eligibility criteria, prognostic factors, and temozolomide treatment (hazard 
      ratio, 5.3; P = .0013; n = 17). The development of specific antibody (P = .025)
      or delayed-type hypersensitivity (P = .03) responses to EGFRvIII had a
      significant effect on OS. At recurrence, 82% (95% CI, 48% to 97%) of patients had
      lost EGFRvIII expression (P < .001). CONCLUSION: EGFRvIII-targeted vaccination in
      patients with GBM warrants investigation in a phase III, randomized trial.

TI  - Evaluation of anti-podoplanin rat monoclonal antibody NZ-1 for targeting
      malignant gliomas.
PG  - 785-94
LID - 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2010.03.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Podoplanin/aggrus is a mucin-like sialoglycoprotein that is highly 
      expressed in malignant gliomas. Podoplanin has been reported to be a novel marker
      to enrich tumor-initiating cells, which are thought to resist conventional
      therapies and to be responsible for cancer relapse. The purpose of this study was
      to determine whether an anti-podoplanin antibody is suitable to target
      radionuclides to malignant gliomas. METHODS: The binding affinity of an
      anti-podoplanin antibody, NZ-1 (rat IgG(2a)), was determined by surface plasmon
      resonance and Scatchard analysis. NZ-1 was radioiodinated with (125)I using
      Iodogen [(125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen)] or N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl
      3-[(131)I]iodobenzoate ([(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1), and paired-label internalization
      assays of NZ-1 were performed. The tissue distribution of (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen)
      and that of [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 were then compared in athymic mice bearing
      glioblastoma xenografts. RESULTS: The dissociation constant (K(D)) of NZ-1 was
      determined to be 1.2 x 10(-10) M by surface plasmon resonance and 9.8 x 10(-10) M
      for D397MG glioblastoma cells by Scatchard analysis. Paired-label internalization
      assays in LN319 glioblastoma cells indicated that [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 resulted in 
      higher intracellular retention of radioactivity (26.3 +/- 0.8% of initially bound
      radioactivity at 8 h) compared to that from the (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen) (10.0 +/-
      0.1% of initially bound radioactivity at 8 h). Likewise, tumor uptake of
      [(131)I]SGMIB-NZ-1 (39.9 +/- 8.8 %ID/g at 24 h) in athymic mice bearing D2159MG
      xenografts in vivo was significantly higher than that of (125)I-NZ-1(Iodogen)
      (29.7 +/- 6.1 %ID/g at 24 h). CONCLUSIONS: The overall results suggest that an
      anti-podoplanin antibody NZ-1 warrants further evaluation for antibody-based
      therapy against glioblastoma.

      malignant tumors, and from infectious to post-inflammatory. Pigmented lesions are
      much less easily diagnosed on anogenital skin, and clinicians should have a low

TI  - Elevated pulmonary artery pressure is a risk factor for primary graft dysfunction
      following lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 782-787

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is often associated with
      elevations in pulmonary artery pressures. Although primary pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) has been associated with primary graft dysfunction (PGD), the 
      role of secondary PAH in mediating PGD risk in patients with IPF is incompletely 
      understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between
      mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and PGD among patients with IPF. METHODS:
      We performed a multicenter prospective cohort study of 126 lung transplant
      procedures performed for IPF between March 2002 and August 2007. The primary
      outcome was grade 3 PGD at 72 h after lung transplant. The mPAP was measured as
      the initial reading following insertion of the right-sided heart catheter during 
      lung transplant. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for
      confounding variables. RESULTS: The mPAP for patients with PGD was 38.5 +/- 16.3 
      mm Hg vs 29.6 +/- 11.5 mm Hg for patients without PGD (mean difference, 8.9 mm Hg
      [95% CI, 3.6-14.2]; P = .001). The increase in odds of PGD associated with each
      10-mm Hg increase in mPAP was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.18-2.26; P = .003). In
      multivariable models, this relationship was independent of confounding by other
      clinical variables, although the use of cardiopulmonary bypass partially
      attenuated the relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Higher mPAP in patients with IPF is
      associated with the development of PGD.

AB  - In patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH),
      ventriculomegaly and narrowed subarachnoid spaces at the high convexity appear in
      magnetic resonance (MR) images before the occurrence of objective symptoms. In
      addition, quantitative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) has been reported to
      be reduced in iNPH patients with objective symptoms. To determine whether reduced
      rCBF is responsible for the appearance of symptoms, we compared rCBF in patients 
      with suspected iNPH with no objective triad symptoms (NOS), iNPH patients with
      apparent objective triad symptoms (AOS) and normal control subjects (NC).
      Regional CBF was quantified in 35 Regions-of-interest (ROIs) by 123I-IMP single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the autoradiography (ARG)
      method. Multiple comparisons showed that, in all brain regions examined except
      for in the frontal white matter, rCBF in the NOS group was significantly lower
      than that in the NC group, but in all brain regions, not significantly different 
      from that of the AOS group. These results suggest that factors other than rCBF in
      the resting state are responsible for the occurrence of objective symptoms of
      iNPH.

PG  - 371-9
LID - 10.1007/s11060-010-0403-6 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated the efficacy of metronomic etoposide or temozolomide administered
      with bevacizumab among recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients who progressed on
      prior bevacizumab therapy in a phase 2, open-label, two-arm trial. Twenty-three
      patients received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks with either oral etoposide
      (50 mg/m2) daily for 21 consecutive days each month or daily temozolomide (50
      mg/m2). The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) and
      secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. Both the etoposide and 
      temozolomide arms of the study closed at the interim analysis due to lack of
      adequate anti-tumor activity. No radiographic responses were observed. Although
      12 patients (52%) achieved stable disease, PFS-6 was 4.4% and the median PFS was 
      7.3 weeks. The only grade 4 adverse event was reversible neutropenia. Grade 3
      toxicities included fatigue (n = 2) and infection (n = 1). Metronomic etoposide
      or temozolomide is ineffective when administered with bevacizumab among recurrent
      GBM patients who have progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy. Alternative
      treatment strategies remain critically needed for this indication.

TI  - Heparin modifies the immunogenicity of positively charged proteins.
PG  - 6046-53

AB  - The immune response in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is initiated by and
      directed to large multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin
      (H). We have previously shown that PF4:H multimolecular complexes assemble
      through electrostatic interactions and, once formed, are highly immunogenic in
      vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that other positively charged 
      proteins would exhibit similar biologic interactions with H. To test this
      hypothesis, we selected 2 unrelated positively charged proteins, protamine (PRT) 
      and lysozyme, and studied H-dependent interactions using in vitro and in vivo
      techniques. Our studies indicate that PRT/H and lysozyme/H, like PF4/H, show
      H-dependent binding over a range of H concentrations and that formation of
      complexes occurs at distinct stoichiometric ratios. We show that protein/H
      complexes are capable of eliciting high-titer antigen-specific antibodies in a
      murine immunization model and that PRT/H antibodies occur in patients undergoing 
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Finally, our studies indicate that protein/H
      complexes, but not uncomplexed protein, directly activate dendritic cells in
      vitro leading to interleukin-12 release. Taken together, these studies indicate
      that H significantly alters the biophysical and biologic properties of positively
      charged compounds through formation of multimolecular complexes that lead to
      dendritic cell activation and trigger immune responses in vivo.

TI  - Association between body mass index and mortality in patients with glioblastoma
      mutliforme.
PG  - 2195-201
LID - 10.1007/s10552-010-9639-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the association between obesity and survival in patients with
      glioblastoma mutliforme (GBM) METHODS: Using a prospective design, 1,259 patients
      with previously untreated GBM were recruited between 1991 and 2008. Height and
      weight were self-reported or abstracted from medical records at study entry and
      used to calculate body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg)/[height (m)](2). Cox
      proportional models were used to estimate the risk of death associated with BMI
      as a continuous variable or categorized using established criteria (normal
      weight, 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2); overweight, 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2); obese, >/= 30.0
      kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 40 months, and 1,069 (85%) deaths were
      observed during this period. For all patients, minimal adjusted analyses
      indicated no significant association between BMI treated as a continuous variable
      and survival. Compared with patients with a BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2), the minimally 
      adjusted HR for overall survival was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.94-1.24) for a BMI 25-29.9
      kg/m(2) and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.91-28) for a BMI >/= 30.0 kg/m(2). After additional
      adjustment for adjuvant therapy, the HR for those with a BMI of 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)
      was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99-1.32) and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.91-1.30) for those with a BMI
      >/= 30.0 kg/m(2). No significant interactions were revealed for BMI and any
      demographic variables. CONCLUSION: BMI was not associated with survival in newly 
      diagnosed and previously untreated patients with GBM. Further research
      investigating the prognostic significance of alternative, quantitative measures
      of body habitus, and functional performance are required.

TI  - Clinical features differentiating biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal
      cholestasis.
PG  - 648-54
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study determined any clinical features which may help to
      differentiate biliary atresia (BA) from other causes of neonatal cholestasis
      (NC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and observational study was conducted 
      on consecutive infants with NC referred to the University of Malaya Medical
      Centre, Malaysia, between November 1996 and May 2004. RESULTS: The 3 most common 
      causes of cholestasis among the 146 infants with NC studied were idiopathic
      neonatal hepatitis (n = 63, 43%), BA (n = 35, 24%) and congenital cytomegalovirus
      hepatitis (n = 13, 9%). Common clinical features at presentation were jaundice
      (100%), hepatomegaly (95%), splenomegaly (52%) and pale stools (47%). Three
      clinical features noted to be sensitive for BA were the presence of acholic or
      variably acholic stools on admission, a liver which was firm/hard in consistency 
      and a palpable liver of >/=4 cm (sensitivity of 77%, 80% and 94%, respectively), 
      but the corresponding specificity was poor (51%, 65% and 39%, respectively). The 
      stools of 2 children with BA were pigmented initially but became acholic
      subsequently. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any single clinical feature with
      sufficient sensitivity and specificity to differentiate BA from other causes of
      NC. Repeated inspection of stools colour is necessary as occasionally, patients
      with BA may have initial pigmented stools. Biochemical assessment and imaging
      studies are important in the assessment of any infant with NC.

TI  - Mechanisms of tolerance to parental parathyroid tissue when combined with human
      allogeneic thymus transplantation.
PG  - 814-820.e8
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.07.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The induction of tolerance toward third-party solid organ grafts with
      allogeneic thymus tissue transplantation has not been previously demonstrated in 
      human subjects. OBJECTIVE: Infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly (having neither
      thymus nor parathyroid function) were studied for conditions and mechanisms
      required for the development of tolerance to third-party solid organ tissues.
      METHODS: Four infants who met the criteria received parental parathyroid with
      allogeneic thymus transplantation and were studied. RESULTS: Two of 3 survivors
      showed function of both grafts but subsequently lost parathyroid function. They
      demonstrated alloreactivity against the parathyroid donor in mixed lymphocyte
      cultures. For these 2 recipients, parathyroid donor HLA class II alleles were
      mismatched with the recipient and thymus. MHC class II tetramers confirmed the
      presence of recipient CD4(+) T cells with specificity toward a mismatched
      parathyroid donor class II allele. The third survivor has persistent graft
      function and lacks alloreactivity toward the parathyroid donor. All parathyroid
      donor class II alleles were shared with either the recipient or the thymus graft,
      with minor differences between the parathyroid (HLA-DRB1 *1104) and thymus
      (HLA-DRB1 *1101). Tetramer analyses detected recipient T cells specific for the
      parathyroid HLA-DRB1 *1104 allele. Alloreactivity toward the parathyroid donor
      was restored with low doses of IL-2. CONCLUSION: Tolerance toward parathyroid
      grafts in combined parental parathyroid and allogeneic thymus transplantation
      requires matching of thymus tissue to parathyroid HLA class II alleles to promote
      negative selection and suppression of recipient T cells that have alloreactivity 
      toward the parathyroid grafts. This matching strategy may be applied toward
      tolerance induction in future combined thymus and solid organ transplantation
      efforts.

TI  - Eltrombopag (75 mg) does not induce photosensitivity: results of a clinical
      pharmacology trial.
PG  - 243-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0781.2010.00538.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Eltrombopag is an oral, small molecule, thrombopoietin
      receptor agonist approved in the United States for the treatment of chronic
      immune thrombocytopenic purpura and under investigation for treatment of
      thrombocytopenia due to other etiologies. In vitro studies identified a
      phototoxic potential for eltrombopag that was not confirmed in subsequent animal 
      studies at exposures up to 11 times the human clinical exposure. A randomized
      study in healthy men and women was conducted to more fully characterize the
      photosensitizing potential of a therapeutic dose of eltrombopag (75 mg q.i.d.).
      METHODS: In this placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study, the
      photosensitizing potential of eltrombopag was evaluated in 36 healthy subjects
      with 12 subjects per group treated for 6 days with eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d.,
      placebo q.i.d., or positive control ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d. (a mild
      photosensitizer). The primary endpoint was the photosensitizing potential of
      eltrombopag in comparison with the placebo on day 6 as measured by the phototoxic
      index (PI) at 24-h postirradiation, delayed erythema, and the change from
      baseline in minimum erythemal dose (MED) at 24-h postirradiation. The PI and MED 
      were determined at discrete wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light
      spectrum from 290 to 430 nm. RESULTS: At wavelengths of 295+/-5, 300+/-5,
      305+/-30 nm, and solar simulator whole spectrum (SS WS), there were no notable
      median differences in delayed PI or change from baseline MED at 24-h
      postirradiation after administration of eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d., placebo, or
      ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d. Mild phototoxicity induced by ciprofloxacin 500 mg
      b.i.d. was observed at wavelengths of 335+/-30 and 365+/-30 nm within the UVA
      region. Following administration of ciprofloxacin, the median difference in
      delayed PI relative to placebo at wavelengths of 335+/-30 and 365+/-30 nm was
      increased to 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.222-2.037] and 1.20 (95% CI,
      0.404-1.720), respectively. However, there was no evidence that photosensitivity 
      was increased following administration of eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d. There were no 
      significant differences between median delayed PI following administration of
      repeat doses of eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d. and repeat doses of placebo at
      wavelengths of 335+/-30 and 365+/-30 nm. Comparing eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d. with 
      ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d., the median difference in delayed PI for wavelengths 
      of 335+/-30 and 365+/-30 nm was decreased to -0.94 (95% CI, -2.037 to -0.289) and
      -1.38 (95% CI, -1.882 to -0.432), respectively. With 6 days of treatment,
      eltrombopag and placebo did not increase the photosensitivity of the skin, while 
      the positive control ciprofloxacin did increase the photosensitivity of skin,
      resulting in mild phototoxicity. Administration of eltrombopag for 6 days was
      well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs), or drug-related AEs
      leading to discontinuation were observed during the study. There were no
      meaningful differences in AEs reported between the eltrombopag-treated group and 
      either the placebo or ciprofloxacin-treated group. CONCLUSION: Repeat dosing of
      eltrombopag 75 mg q.i.d. for 6 days in healthy men and women did not induce
      photosensitivity at any wavelength tested (UVA, ultraviolet B) in this study.
      Eltrombopag is well tolerated and does not induce photosensitivity.

      progress.
PG  - 401-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nic.2010.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Radiation therapy remains a critical therapeutic modality in the treatment of
      adult brain tumors. However, its use continues to evolve depending on the
      histologic findings of the brain tumor. In high-grade gliomas, current trials
      focus on the addition of systemic agents and optimization of target delineation
      to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy. In low-grade gliomas, the life 
      expectancy is much greater, and the possibility of late effects of radiotherapy
      have shaped contemporary trials to attempt to identify groups that benefit from
      radiotherapy versus the ones that may defer radiotherapy until tumor progression.
      With primary central nervous system lymphoma, the advent of high-dose
      methotrexate-based chemotherapy and the risk of severe early neurocognitive
      toxicity have brought the role of radiotherapy into question. With meningioma,
      the use of normal tissue-sparing techniques such as radiosurgery has allowed for 
      the successful treatment of patients who are eminently curable and with a life
      expectancy that is generally no different than that of the general population.
      Particular attention in this review is paid to current approaches, contemporary
      trials, and modern therapeutic dilemmas.

      suprasellar-prepontine arachnoid cysts using endoscopic third
      ventriculocystocisternostomy.
PG  - 206-16
LID - 10.1177/1553350610377212 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial endoscopy has emerged as an innovative surgical tool for various
      intracranial procedures, but its use remains limited to neurosurgeons trained in 
      this minimally invasive technique. Complex, skull base arachnoid cysts represent 
      one entity that is challenging to treat because of adjacent critical
      neurovascular structures; however, the advent of intracranial endoscopic
      techniques has revolutionized treatment. Arachnoid cysts located in the
      suprasellar-prepontine skull base region can cause obstructive hydrocephalus or
      symptomatic mass effect and require urgent decompression. These patients may
      present with nonfocal symptoms that can quickly lead to a life-threatening
      condition if not accurately diagnosed and treated. The authors present a summary 
      of the world literature of suprasellar-prepontine arachnoid cysts (SPACs) to
      ascertain clinical presentations and provide class III evidentiary treatment
      guidelines for this uniquely challenging type of arachnoid cyst. Urgent
      endoscopic third ventriculostomy results in normalization of intracranial
      pressure, return of normal CSF flow, and relief of symptoms.

LID - 10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181cb3fbe [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Grover disease is a clinicopathologic entity characterized by
      acantholysis. The histologic changes typically occupy circumscribed foci,
      therefore early stages could go unnoticed and be misdiagnosed. OBJECTIVE: To
      report on early histopathologic changes in Grover disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      We analyzed 22 cases of Grover disease histologically diagnosed at Wake Forest
      University School of Medicine, NC, between 2000 and 2009. Early changes were
      defined as elongation of rete ridges and mild focal acantholysis. RESULTS: Six
      cases (27%) showed elongation of the rete ridges with focal acantholysis. Mild
      spongiosis was seen in 4 cases. Superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate 
      was found in all cases, 5 of which showed eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings may represent a diagnostic clue in cases of early Grover disease, if
      clinical correlation is made.

TI  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations in cancer: alterations at a crossroads
      of cellular metabolism.
PG  - 932-41
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djq187 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of metabolism is a common phenomenon in cancer cells. The
      NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) function at a
      crossroads of cellular metabolism in lipid synthesis, cellular defense against
      oxidative stress, oxidative respiration, and oxygen-sensing signal transduction. 
      We review the normal functions of the encoded enzymes, frequent mutations of IDH1
      and IDH2 recently found in human cancers, and possible roles for the mutated
      enzymes in human disease. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in some types 
      of World Health Organization grades 2-4 gliomas and in acute myeloid leukemias
      with normal karyotype. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are remarkably specific to codons 
      that encode conserved functionally important arginines in the active site of each
      enzyme. To date, all IDH1 mutations have been identified at the Arg132 codon.
      Mutations in IDH2 have been identified at the Arg140 codon, as well as at Arg172,
      which is aligned with IDH1 Arg132. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are usually
      heterozygous in cancer, and they appear to confer a neomorphic enzyme activity
      for the enzymes to catalyze the production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Study of
      alterations in these metabolic enzymes may provide insights into the metabolism
      of cancer cells and uncover novel avenues for development of anticancer
      therapeutics.

AB  - Nuclear pores are large protein complexes that cross the nuclear envelope, which 
      is the double membrane surrounding the eukaryotic cell nucleus. There are about
      on average 2,000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the nuclear envelope of a
      vertebrate cell, but it varies depending on cell type and the stage in the life
      cycle. The proteins that make up the NPC are known as nucleoporins. In mammalian 
      cells, Nup107 is the homolog of yeast Nup84p nucleoporin. Nup107 contains a
      leucine zipper motif in its carboxyl-terminal region and numerous kinase
      consensus sites, but does not contain FG repeats. Previously it was reported that
      NUP88 and NUP107 are over expressed in many types of cancers including colon,
      breast, prostrate, etc. In this study, we were interested in investigating the
      role of NUP107 in grade 4 Astrocytoma, i.e., Glioblastoma multiforme cultured
      cell line. We transfected human Astrocytoma cells with Nup107-specific siRNA
      duplexes. The level of mRNA for Nup107 was monitored by RT-PCR, 24, 48, and 72 h 
      after the initial transfection. Nup107 mRNA was significantly diminished by 24 h 
      after transfection and we took that as our incubation time. Next we studied the
      effect of this inhibition on cell viability. We did a Trypan Blue cell viability 
      assay and it showed increased cell death in NUP107 transfected cells than
      untreated control. We further tried to analyze the nature of the cell death
      whether apoptotic or necrotic by doing apoptosis assays like ssDNA ELISA assay,
      Caspase-3, and Caspase-8 assays. All the assays showed that siRNA transfected
      cells are undergoing increased apoptosis than control.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A-inducing anti-epileptics on sorafenib exposure: results of a
      phase II study of sorafenib plus daily temozolomide in adults with recurrent
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 57-66
LID - 10.1007/s11060-010-0217-6 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral VEGFR-2, Raf, PDGFR, c-KIT and Flt-3 inhibitor, is active
      against renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas, and has recently demonstrated
      promising activity for lung and breast cancers. In addition, various protracted
      temozolomide dosing schedules have been evaluated as a strategy to further
      enhance its anti-tumor activity. We reasoned that sorafenib and protracted, daily
      temozolomide may provide complementary therapeutic benefit, and therefore
      performed a phase 2 trial among recurrent glioblastoma patients. Adult
      glioblastoma patients at any recurrence after standard temozolomide
      chemoradiotherapy received sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) and continuous daily
      temozolomide (50 mg/m(2)/day). Assessments were performed every eight weeks. The 
      primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and secondary 
      end points were radiographic response, overall survival (OS), safety and
      sorafenib pharmacokinetics. Of 32 enrolled patients, 12 (38%) were on CYP3-A
      inducing anti-epileptics (EIAEDs), 17 (53%) had 2 or more prior progressions, 15 
      had progressed while receiving 5-day temozolomide, and 12 (38%) had failed either
      prior bevacizumab or VEGFR inhibitor therapy. The most common grade >/= 3
      toxicities were palmer-planter erythrodysesthesia (19%) and elevated
      amylase/lipase (13%). Sorafenib pharmacokinetic exposures were comparable on day 
      1 regardless of EIAED status, but significantly lower on day 28 for patients on
      EIAEDs (P = 0.0431). With a median follow-up of 93 weeks, PFS-6 was 9.4%. Only
      one patient (3%) achieved a partial response. In conclusion, sorafenib can be
      safely administered with daily temozolomide, but this regimen has limited
      activity for recurrent GBM. Co-administration of EIAEDs can lower sorafenib
      exposures in this population.

TI  - Parvovirus-associated cerebellar hypoplasia and hydrocephalus in day old broiler 
      chickens.
PG  - 156-60
AB  - Cerebellar hypoplasia and hydrocephalus were identified in day old broiler
      chickens showing nervous signs, impaired mobility, and diarrhea. At postmortem
      examination, brains of chickens were misshapen and cerebellums were smaller than 
      normal. Microscopically, cerebellar folia were reduced in size and irregularly
      shaped, and the ventricles were widely distended. Affected cerebellums had focal 
      areas along the base of folia where the internal granular cell layer had been
      lost, and Purkinje cells were disorganized and located within the molecular
      layer. Parvovirus DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in three of nine 
      brains with oligonucleotide primers designed for amplification of chicken and
      turkey parvoviruses. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, the detected virus
      was most closely related to chicken parvoviruses. These findings suggest that a
      chicken parvovirus might cause a neurologic disease of young chickens
      characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and hydrocephalus; however, its role as
      the cause of the disease remains to be confirmed.

TI  - Hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
PG  - 263-70
LID - 10.1016/j.nec.2009.10.013 [doi]
AB  - Hydrocephalus is a common and potentially devastating complication of aneurysmal 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Its incidence is approximately 20% to 30%, and its
      onset can be acute, within 48 hours after SAH, or rarely chronic, occurring in a 
      delayed fashion weeks and even months after the hemorrhage. Early recognition of 
      its signs and symptoms and accurate interpretation of computed tomography (CT)
      studies are important for the management of patients with SAH. Clinically, a poor
      neurologic grade has the highest correlation with an increased incidence of
      hydrocephalus. Radiographically, the bicaudate index on CT studies has emerged as
      the best marker of this condition. Although further studies are needed to
      understand the complex pathophysiology of this condition, hydrocephalus after SAH
      can be treated effectively using current technology.

AB  - PVS-RIPO is a genetically recombinant, non-pathogenic poliovirus chimera with a
      tumor-specific conditional replication phenotype. Consisting of the genome of the
      live attenuated poliovirus type 1 (Sabin) vaccine with its cognate IRES element
      replaced with that of human rhinovirus type 2, PVS-RIPO displays an inability to 
      translate its genome in untransformed neuronal cells, but effectively does so in 
      cells originating from primary tumors in the central nervous system or other
      cancers. Hence, PVS-RIPO unleashes potent cytotoxic effects on infected cancer
      cells and produces sustained anti-tumoral responses in animal tumor models.
      PVS-RIPO presents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme, based on conditions favoring an unconventional viral translation
      initiation mechanism in cancerous cells. In this review we summarize advances in 
      the understanding of major molecular determinants of PVS-RIPO oncolytic efficacy 
      and safety and discuss their implications for upcoming clinical investigations.

AB  - Thymus transplantation is a promising investigational therapy for infants born
      with no thymus. Because of the athymia, these infants lack T cell development and
      have a severe primary immunodeficiency. Although thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is 
      characteristic of DiGeorge anomaly, in "complete" DiGeorge anomaly, there is no
      detectable thymus as determined by the absence of naive (CD45RA(+), CD62L(+)) T
      cells. Transplantation of postnatal allogeneic cultured thymus tissue was
      performed in sixty subjects with complete DiGeorge anomaly who were under the age
      of 2 years. Recipient survival was over 70%. Naive T cells developed 3-5 months
      after transplantation. The graft recipients were able to discontinue antibiotic
      prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. Immunosuppression was used in a
      subset of subjects but was discontinued when naive T cells developed. The adverse
      events have been acceptable with thyroid disease being the most common. Research 
      continues on mechanisms underlying immune reconstitution after thymus
      transplantation.

AB  - DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a key non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) 
      nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various DNA metabolic and
      damage signaling pathways contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability
      and prevention of cancer. To examine the role of DNA-PK in processing of non-DSB 
      clustered DNA damage, we have used three models of DNA-PK deficiency, i.e.,
      chemical inactivation of its kinase activity by the novel inhibitors IC86621 and 
      NU7026, knockdown and complete absence of the protein in human breast cancer
      (MCF-7) and glioblastoma cell lines (MO59-J/K). A compromised DNA-PK repair
      pathway led to the accumulation of clustered DNA lesions induced by gamma-rays.
      Tumor cells lacking protein expression or with inhibited kinase activity showed a
      marked decrease in their ability to process oxidatively induced non-DSB clustered
      DNA lesions measured using a modified version of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
      or single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). In all cases, DNA-PK
      inactivation led to a higher level of lesion persistence even after 24-72h of
      repair. We suggest a model in which DNA-PK deficiency affects the processing of
      these clusters first by compromising base excision repair and second by the
      presence of catalytically inactive DNA-PK inhibiting the efficient processing of 
      these lesions owing to the failure of DNA-PK to disassociate from the DNA ends.
      The information rendered will be important for understanding not only cancer
      etiology in the presence of an NHEJ deficiency but also cancer treatments based
      on the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of cluster repair.

TI  - Epidemiology of Cleistanthus collinus (oduvan) poisoning: clinical features and
      risk factors for mortality.
PG  - 223-30
LID - 10.1080/17457300903307094 [doi]
AB  - Cleistanthus collinus (local name: oduvan) poisoning is a common suicidal
      poisoning method used in rural southern India. There are few studies on this
      issue and they have small sample sizes. This study examines the epidemiology of
      oduvan poisoning in a large sample, highlighting socio-demographic and clinical
      profile, complications, and risk factors for mortality. This study is a
      retrospective case series of 127 oduvan intentionally poisoned patients
      presenting at a tertiary care teaching hospital between the years 1990-1999.
      Descriptive statistics, cumulative case fatality rates and time to death from
      ingestion of poison were calculated. Cox regression adjusting for left truncation
      was used to investigate the effects of covariates on death. Patients' average
      (sd) age was 29.1 (10.9), 62% were female, 76% were married and 49% were
      housewives. The cumulative case fatality rate was 30%. The median time to death
      after oduvan ingestion was 3 days. Common signs and symptoms included
      hypokalaemia, vomiting, hyponatraemia, altered sensorium, bradycardia and
      abnormal ECG. There was a 58% risk reduction (95% CI: 29-75) in death with each 1
      mmol/l increase in plasma potassium level. Patient's age was associated with an
      increased risk of death and the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of 10
      years in age was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.18-2.07). Use of boiled oduvan extract was
      associated with an increased mortality (HR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.17-6.32) compared to 
      ingesting fresh leaves. Risk factors for oduvan poisoning mortality were
      hypokalaemia, older age, mode of consumption and an elevated risk for death with 
      presence of chronic disease. When consumed as a boiled extract, oduvan is more
      lethal. We recommend close monitoring, correction of plasma potassium and
      appropriate supportive measures.

TI  - Center variation and outcomes associated with delayed sternal closure after stage
      1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
PG  - 1205-10
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.11.029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is debate whether primary or delayed sternal closure is the best
      strategy after stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We
      describe center variation in delayed sternal closure after stage 1 palliation and
      associated outcomes. METHODS: Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Database
      participants performing stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome
      from 2000 to 2007 were included. We examined center variation in delayed sternal 
      closure and compared in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (length of
      stay > 6 weeks), and postoperative infection in centers with low (< or = 25% of
      cases), middle (26%-74% of cases), and high (> or = 75% of cases) delayed sternal
      closure use, adjusting for patient and center factors. RESULTS: There were 1283
      patients (45 centers) included. Median age at surgery was 6 days (interquartile
      range, 4-9 days), and median weight at surgery was 3.2 kg (interquartile range,
      2.8-3.5 kg); 59% were male. Delayed sternal closure was used in 74% of cases
      (range, 3%-100% of cases/center). In centers with high (n = 23) and middle (n =
      17) versus low (n = 5) delayed sternal closure use, there was a greater
      proportion of patients with prolonged length of stay and infection, and a trend
      toward increased in-hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis. In multivariable
      analysis, there was no difference in mortality. Centers with high and middle
      delayed sternal closure use had prolonged length of stay (odds ratio, 2.83; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.46-5.47; P = .002 and odds ratio, 2.23; confidence
      interval, 1.17-4.26; P = .02, respectively) and more infection (odds ratio, 2.34;
      confidence interval, 1.20-4.57; P = .01 and odds ratio, 2.37; confidence
      interval, 1.36-4.16; P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Use of delayed sternal 
      closure after stage 1 palliation varies widely. These observational data suggest 
      that more frequent use of delayed sternal closure is associated with longer
      length of stay and higher postoperative infection rates. Further evaluation of
      the risks and benefits of delayed sternal closure in the management of these
      complex infants is necessary.

TI  - EGFR and EGFRvIII interact with PUMA to inhibit mitochondrial translocalization
      of PUMA and PUMA-mediated apoptosis independent of EGFR kinase activity.
PG  - 101-10
LID - 10.1016/j.canlet.2010.01.028 [doi]
AB  - EGFR and its constitutively activated variant EGFRvIII are linked to glioblastoma
      resistance to therapy, the mechanisms underlying this association, however, are
      still unclear. We report that in glioblastoma, EGFR/EGFRvIII paradoxically
      co-expresses with p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a proapoptotic
      member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins primarily located on the mitochondria.
      EGFR/EGFRvIII binds to PUMA constitutively and under apoptotic stress, and
      subsequently sequesters PUMA in the cytoplasm. The EGFR-PUMA interaction is
      independent of EGFR activation and is sustained under EGFR inhibition. A
      Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor that mimics PUMA activity sensitizes
      EGFR/EGFRvIII-expressing glioblastoma cells to Iressa. Collectively, we uncovered
      a novel kinase-independent function of EGFR/EGFRvIII that leads to tumor drug
      resistance.

TI  - Patients' benefit-risk preferences for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic
      purpura therapies.
PG  - 479-88
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M567 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) primarily is a disorder of 
      adults characterized by autoantibody-induced platelet destruction and reduced
      platelet production, leading to a low peripheral blood platelet count. The
      long-term management of many patients with chronic ITP is unsatisfactory, largely
      due to the variable efficacy and risks of severe adverse effects associated with 
      current treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To estimate patients' benefit-risk
      preferences for treatments for ITP. METHODS: Patients' adverse event risk
      tolerance and the levels of benefit required to offset possible risks were
      evaluated using choice-format conjoint analysis. Subjects chose between pairs of 
      hypothetical treatment alternatives defined by probability of achieving safe
      platelet levels, need for corticosteroids, mode of administration, risk of
      rebound, risk of elevated liver enzyme levels, and risk of thromboembolism.
      RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that patients have clear and measurable
      benefit-risk preferences that physicians should consider when discussing
      treatment options with their patients. Patients were willing to accept
      significant risks of adverse events in return for an increase in the probability 
      of achieving safe platelet levels, to avoid corticosteroids, and for more
      convenient administration. Patients were willing to accept significant risks of
      rebound and elevated liver enzymes for improvements in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results demonstrate that patients with ITP are willing to accept
      treatment-related risks in exchange for improvements in treatment efficacy and
      administration attributes and suggest the importance of considering a patient's
      benefit-risk preferences during discussions of therapeutic options.

AB  - Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare group of autosomal recessive disorders of DNA
      repair unified by the presence of sulfur-deficient brittle hair. We report a
      3-year-old boy with classic clinical features of TTD, including ichthyosis,
      alopecia, developmental delay, and tiger-tail banding of the hair shaft on
      polarizing microscopy. Brain MR imaging showed both diffuse dysmyelination and
      osteosclerosis, findings that, in combination, may be specific for TTD.

TI  - New advances in the treatment of adult chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura:
      role of thrombopoietin receptor-stimulating agents.
PG  - 499-513
AB  - Decades of basic science and clinical research have led to an increased
      understanding of the pathophysiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),
      the processes underlying thrombopoiesis, and the treatment of chronic ITP. Now,
      new agents are available to treat ITP in a nonimmunosuppressive fashion. Lessons 
      learned from the clinical trials of recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO) have
      led to the development of a novel class of compounds: nonimmunogenic agonists of 
      the thrombopoietin receptor. Representing the first nonimmunosuppressive agents
      to treat chronic refractory ITP in decades, medications such as romiplostim and
      eltrombopag were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. These 
      new agents offer physicians a new tool for treating difficult cases of ITP in
      their medical armamentarium. Additional TPO mimetics are also being developed
      that show promise in vitro, and await future development.

LID - 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181bf29b6 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an inherited cerebellar degeneration syndrome often
      associated with immune deficiency, notably, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia,
      and cellular immune dysfunction. Although autoimmunity is a common feature of
      many congenital and acquired immune deficiencies, it has not generally been
      thought to be associated with AT. We report a 7-year-old boy with AT who
      developed acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura while on subcutaneous
      immunoglobulin replacement therapy for hypogammaglobulinemia. He responded
      promptly to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. This case reinforces the notion
      that one must be observant for autoimmune hematologic conditions in any child
      with qualitative or quantitative deficiencies in cellular immunity.

      review.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1038/jp.2009.100 [doi]
AB  - Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is a rare and severe form of congenital ichthyosis.
      Linked to deletion and truncation mutations of a keratinocyte lipid transporter, 
      HI is characterized by diffuse epidermal hyperkeratinization and defective
      desquamation. At birth, the HI phenotype is striking with thick hyperkeratotic
      plate-like scales with deep dermal fissures, severe ectropion and eclabium, among
      other findings. Over the first months of life, the hyperkeratotic covering is
      shed, revealing a diffusely erythematous, scaly epidermis, which persists for the
      remainder of the patient's life. Although HI infants have historically succumbed 
      in the perinatal period related to their profound epidermal compromise, the
      prognosis of HI infants has vastly improved over the past 20 years. Here, we
      report a case of HI treated with acitretin, focusing on the multi-faceted
      management of the disease in the inpatient setting. A review of the literature of
      the management of HI during the perinatal period is also presented.

TI  - EGFR-targeted therapy in malignant glioma: novel aspects and mechanisms of drug
      resistance.
PG  - 37-52
AB  - Glioblastoma, GBM, is the most frequent brain malignancy in adults. Patients with
      these tumors survive only, approximately, one year after diagnosis and rarely
      survive beyond two years. This poor prognosis is, in part, due to our
      insufficient understanding of the complex aggressive nature of these tumors and
      the lack of effective therapy. In GBM, over-expression of EGFR and/or its
      constitutively activated variant EGFRvIII is a major characteristic and is
      associated with tumorigenesis and more aggressive phenotypes, such as,
      invasiveness and therapeutic resistance. Consequently, both have been major
      targets for GBM therapy, however, clinical trials of EGFR- and EGFRvIII-targeted 
      therapies have yielded unsatisfactory results and the molecular basis for the
      poor results is still unclear. Thus, in this review, we will summarize results of
      recent clinical trials and recent advances made in the understanding of the
      EGFR/EGFRvIII pathways with a key focus on those associated with intrinsic
      resistance of GBM to EGFR-targeted therapy. For example, emerging evidence
      indicates an important role that PTEN plays in predicting GBM response to
      EGFR-targeted therapy. Aberrant Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to contribute to 
      the resistant phenotype. Also, several studies have reported that EGFR/EGFRvIII's
      cross-talk with the oncogenic transcription factorSTAT3 and receptor tyrosine
      kinases, (c-Met and PDGFR) potentially lead to GBM resistance to anti-EGFR
      therapy. Other emerging mechanisms, including one involving HMG-CoA reductase,
      will also be discussed in this mini-review. These recent findings have provided
      new insight into the highly complex and interactive nature of the EGFR pathway
      and generated rationales for novel combinational targeted therapies for these
      tumors.

      anticoagulation.
PG  - 225-32
LID - 10.1182/asheducation-2009.1.225 [doi]
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated disorder caused by
      the development of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The
      thrombocytopenia is typically moderate, with a median platelet count nadir of
      approximately 50 to 60 x 10(9) platelets/L. Severe thrombocytopenia has been
      described in patients with HIT, and in these patients antibody levels are high
      and severe clinical outcomes have been reported (eg, disseminated intravascular
      coagulation with microvascular thrombosis). The timing of the thrombocytopenia in
      relation to the initiation of heparin therapy is critically important, with the
      platelet count beginning to drop within 5 to 10 days of starting heparin. A more 
      rapid drop in the platelet count can occur in patients who have been recently
      exposed to heparin (within the preceding 3 months), due to preformed
      anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies. A delayed form of HIT has also been described that
      develops within days or weeks after the heparin has been discontinued. In
      contrast to other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT is characterized by an
      increased risk for thromboembolic complications, primarily venous
      thromboembolism. Heparin and all heparin-containing products should be
      discontinued and an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant initiated. Alternative
      agents that have been used effectively in patients with HIT include lepirudin,
      argatroban, bivalirudin, and danaparoid, although the last agent is not available
      in North America. Fondaparinux has been used in a small number of patients with
      HIT and generally appears to be safe. Warfarin therapy should not be initiated
      until the platelet count has recovered and the patient is systemically
      anticoagulated, and vitamin K should be administered to patients receiving
      warfarin at the time of diagnosis of HIT.

AB  - Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with cognitive
      deficits and morphometric brain abnormalities in childhood and a markedly
      elevated risk of schizophrenia in adolescence/early adulthood. Determining the
      relationship between neurocognition and neuroimaging findings would yield crucial
      information about childhood neurodevelopment and provide a basis for the study of
      the trajectory that occurs on the pathway to psychosis. We compared morphometric 
      brain findings between non-psychotic children with 22q11DS (n = 22) and healthy
      controls (n = 16), and examined the association between neurocognitive
      functioning and morphometric brain findings. Volumetric regional gray matter
      differences between the 22q11DS and control subjects were measured, and
      correlations of the regional gray matter volumes and neurocognition were
      performed. Children with 22q11DS demonstrated reductions in gray matter in
      several brain regions, chiefly the frontal cortices, the cingulate gyrus and the 
      cerebellum. The volumetric reductions in these salient areas were associated with
      poor performance in sustained attention, executive function and verbal memory;
      however, the relation of brain volume with cognitive performance did not differ
      between the patient and control groups. Thus, children with 22q11DS demonstrate
      gray matter reductions in multiple brain regions that are thought to be relevant 
      to schizophrenia. The correlation of these volumetric reductions with poor
      neurocognition indicates that these brain regions may mediate higher
      neurocognitive functions implicated in schizophrenia.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant, relentless brain cancer with no known
      cure, and standard therapies leave significant room for the development of
      better, more effective treatments. Immunotherapy is a promising approach to the
      treatment of solid tumors that directs the patient's own immune system to destroy
      tumor cells. The most successful immunologically based cancer therapy to date
      involves the passive administration of monoclonal antibodies, but significant
      antitumor responses have also been generated with active vaccination strategies
      and cell-transfer therapies. This article summarizes the important components of 
      the immune system, discusses the specific difficulty of immunologic privilege in 
      the central nervous system, and reviews treatment approaches that are being
      attempted, with an emphasis on active immunotherapy using peptide vaccines.

TI  - Recombinant single-chain variable fragment antibodies against extracellular
      epitopes of human multidrug resistance protein MRP3 for targeting malignant
      gliomas.
PG  - 598-611
LID - 10.1002/ijc.25062 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), a multidrug resistance protein identified 
      by serial analysis of gene expression as a glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM)-associated molecule, is highly expressed in GBM, but not in normal brain
      cells. Thus, MRP3 is a candidate for GBM immunotargeting, but to date, no
      monoclonal antibody has been isolated that can target an extracellular MRP3
      epitope. By phage display, we have isolated 3 recombinant, fully human,
      single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies, M25, M58 and M89, which specifically react
      with the extracellular N-terminus of human MRP3. In ELISA, these scFvs reacted
      only with the peptide used for screening and not with other MRP3-derived
      peptides. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these scFv fragments bind
      specifically to viable human GBM cells displaying different MRP3 expression
      levels, but not to MRP3-null cells. Furthermore, these scFv antibodies failed to 
      react with tumor cells overexpressing other MRP proteins, including MRP1, MRP2,
      MRP4 and MRP5. M25 and M58 also bound to viable neurospheres. Iodogen-labeled
      scFvs demonstrated a yield of 56-76%. The immunoreactive fractions of the
      radiolabeled M25, M58 and M89 scFvs were 32, 52 and 69%, respectively. M25
      exhibited 20% internalization into D2159MG neurospheres, M58, 33% into D54MG
      cells and M89, 26% into D247MG. Immunohistochemical evaluation of human gliomas
      to determine the localization of MRP3 antigen using scFvs M25 and M58 showed a
      dense cytoplasmic and membranous staining pattern. These Fv-based recombinant
      antibodies, which possess superior tumor penetration capabilities and selectively
      target tumor cells that express MRP3, may potentially be used in immunotherapy
      and diagnosis for brain tumors and other cancers.

TI  - The cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac sulfide inhibits EP4 expression and
      suppresses the growth of glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 1088-99
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-09-0140 [doi]
AB  - EP4 expression in human glioblastoma cells correlates with growth on soft agar.
      The cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac sulfide first altered specificity protein-1
      (Sp-1) and early growth response gene-1 expression, then increased the expression
      of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene 1 and activating
      transcription factor 3, and then decreased EP4 expression. EP4 suppression was
      dependent on blocking the Sp-1 binding sites in the human EP4 promoter. Mutation 
      in the Sp-1 sites in EP4 altered the promoter activity and abolished sulindac
      sulfide effects. The inhibitory effect of sulindac sulfide on EP4 expression was 
      reversed by PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase kinase-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor. Sp-1
      phosphorylation was dependent on sulindac sulfide-induced Erk activation.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that Sp-1 phosphorylation decreases
      Sp-1 binding to DNA and leads to the suppression of EP4. Inhibition of cell
      growth on soft agar assay was found to be a highly complex process and seems to
      require not only the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity but also increased
      expression of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene 1 and activating
      transcription factor 3 and suppression of EP4 expression. Our data suggest that
      the suppression of EP4 expression by sulindac sulfide represents a new mechanism 
      for understanding the tumor suppressor activity.

TI  - Hypocitraturia: pathophysiology and medical management.
PG  - 134-44
AB  - Low urinary citrate excretion is a known risk factor for the development of
      kidney stones. Citrate inhibits stone formation by complexing with calcium in the
      urine, inhibiting spontaneous nucleation, and preventing growth and agglomeration
      of crystals. Hypocitraturia is a common metabolic abnormality found in 20% to 60%
      of stone formers. It is most commonly idiopathic in origin but may be caused by
      distal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, bowel dysfunction, and a
      high-protein, low-alkali diet. Genetic factors, medications, and other comorbid
      disorders also play a role. Hypocitraturia should be managed through a
      combination of dietary modifications, oral alkali, and possibly lemonade or other
      citrus juice-based therapy. This review concerns the pathophysiology of
      hypocitraturia and the management of stone formers afflicted with this
      abnormality.

      with progressive glioblastoma.
PG  - 1995-2004
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in addition to
      hydroxyurea in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) who were either on or
      not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). METHODS: A total of 231
      patients with GBM at first recurrence from 21 institutions in 10 countries were
      enrolled. All patients received 500 mg of hydroxyurea twice a day. Imatinib was
      administered at 600 mg per day for patients not on EIAEDs and at 500 mg twice a
      day if on EIAEDs. The primary end point was radiographic response rate and
      secondary end points were safety, progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6), 
      and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The radiographic response rate after
      centralised review was 3.4%. Progression-free survival at 6 months and median OS 
      were 10.6% and 26.0 weeks, respectively. Outcome did not appear to differ based
      on EIAED status. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were fatigue
      (7%), neutropaenia (7%), and thrombocytopaenia (7%). CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib in
      addition to hydroxyurea was well tolerated among patients with recurrent GBM but 
      did not show clinically meaningful anti-tumour activity.

TI  - Phase I trial of vinflunine and pemetrexed in refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 131-6
LID - 10.1007/s10637-009-9344-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vinflunine is a novel vinca alkaloid with promising single agent
      clinical activity. Pemetrexed has at least additive activity with other vincas. A
      phase I trial was undertaken to assess the safety of vinflunine and pemetrexed in
      patients with refractory solid tumors. METHODS: A standard 3-patient cohort dose 
      escalation scheme was used to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the vinflunine/pemetrexed combination. Pemetrexed
      500 mg/m(2) was given with vinflunine 280 mg/m(2) (cohort 1), 300 mg/m(2) (cohort
      2) or 320 mg/m(2) (cohort 3) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. RESULTS: 19 patients
      were enrolled, median age 58 years (range 32 to 77) and had a median of 3 (range 
      1-6) prior therapies. DLT occurred 1 of 6 pts in cohort 1 (thrombocytopenia,
      hyponatremia), 2 of 10 pts in cohort 2 (febrile neutropenia, hyponatremia,
      hyperbilirubinema; febrile neutropenia), and 2 of 3 pts in cohort 3 (febrile
      neutropenia, hypokalemia; febrile neutropenia). 1 pt in cohort 2 died prior to
      completion of cycle 1 likely from disease progression. Most common grade 3/4
      adverse events were neutropenia (7), leukopenia (5). Febrile neutropenia occurred
      in 4 patients (21%). No objective responses were seen. Two patients (breast and
      lung) had prolonged stable disease for 25 and 20 cycles respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on this experience we recommend vinflunine 300 mg/m(2) and
      pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) in combination every 3 weeks for future study. At these
      doses, the combination of vinflunine and pemetrexed was tolerable in this heavily
      pretreated population. Hematologic toxicity, including febrile neutropenia, was
      prominent.

TI  - Concurrent temozolomide and radiation, a reasonable option for elderly patients
      with glioblastoma multiforme?
PG  - 265-70
LID - 10.1097/COC.0b013e3181a76a24 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is no accepted standard of care for patients over age 70 with
      glioblastoma (GBM). We began this study to describe our results and toxicities in
      the over 70 population treated with concurrent temozolomide and radiation for
      GBM, and to describe our outcomes treating elderly patients with GBM regardless
      of therapy. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients aged 70 or older who
      were diagnosed with glioblastoma since 2002 at the University of North Carolina
      to determine age at diagnosis, performance status, neurologic status, recursive
      partitioning analysis class, treatment received, and toxicity. Median survival
      was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the Log-rank 
      test. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were identified with a median age of 76 years 
      and a median survival of 20.6 weeks. Thirteen patients received best supportive
      care, 4 patients were treated with radiation alone, and 14 with radiation and
      concurrent temozolomide. The median survival for each group was 8.4, 28.2, and
      50.5 weeks, respectively. Grade 1/2 toxicity was seen in 20% of patients, whereas
      only 1 patient had grade 3 toxicity. Neurologic status (P = 0.0028), performance 
      status (P = 0.0096), and recursive partitioning analysis class (P = 0.0033)
      retained their prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant daily
      temozolomide and radiation followed by adjuvant temozolomide is a tolerable and
      reasonable treatment option and has a good performance status for elderly
      patients diagnosed with glioblastoma.

TI  - Diminished dosage of 22q11 genes disrupts neurogenesis and cortical development
      in a mouse model of 22q11 deletion/DiGeorge syndrome.
PG  - 16434-45
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0905696106 [doi]
AB  - The 22q11 deletion (or DiGeorge) syndrome (22q11DS), the result of a 1.5- to
      3-megabase hemizygous deletion on human chromosome 22, results in dramatically
      increased susceptibility for "diseases of cortical connectivity" thought to arise
      during development, including schizophrenia and autism. We show that diminished
      dosage of the genes deleted in the 1.5-megabase 22q11 minimal critical deleted
      region in a mouse model of 22q11DS specifically compromises neurogenesis and
      subsequent differentiation in the cerebral cortex. Proliferation of basal, but
      not apical, progenitors is disrupted, and subsequently, the frequency of layer
      2/3, but not layer 5/6, projection neurons is altered. This change is paralleled 
      by aberrant distribution of parvalbumin-labeled interneurons in upper and lower
      cortical layers. Deletion of Tbx1 or Prodh (22q11 genes independently associated 
      with 22q11DS phenotypes) does not similarly disrupt basal progenitors. However,
      expression analysis implicates additional 22q11 genes that are selectively
      expressed in cortical precursors. Thus, diminished 22q11 gene dosage disrupts
      cortical neurogenesis and interneuron migration. Such developmental disruption
      may alter cortical circuitry and establish vulnerability for developmental
      disorders, including schizophrenia and autism.

AB  - Neurocysticercosis (NC) is the most frequent and widespread human
      neuroparasitosis. Glioblastoma multiforme, a not infrequent brain neoplasm in
      young adults, may have a similar clinical and radiologic presentation as NC.
      Coexistence of NC and brain tumors has been very rarely reported and puts into
      question a causal relationship between the 2 diseases. Here we report the case of
      a patient in which glioblastoma multiforme and cysticercosis appeared
      concomitantly, making their clinical distinction very difficult.

TI  - Temporal differences in DNA replication during the S phase using single fiber
      analysis of normal human fibroblasts and glioblastoma T98G cells.
PG  - 3133-48
AB  - We have recently shown that replication forks pause near origins in normal human 
      fibroblasts (NHF1-hTERT) but not glioblastoma T98G cells. This observation led us
      to question whether other differences in the replication program may exist
      between these cell types that may relate to their genetic integrity. To identify 
      differences, we detected immunoflourescently the sequential incorporation of the 
      nucleotide analogs IdU and CldU into replicating DNA at the start of every hour
      of a synchronized S phase. We then characterized the patterns of labeled
      replicating DNA tracks and quantified the percentages and lengths of the tracks
      found at these hourly intervals. From the directionality of labeling in single
      extended replicating DNA fibers, tracks were categorized as single bidirectional 
      origins, unidirectional elongations, clusters of origins firing in tandem, or
      merging forks (terminations). Our analysis showed that the start of S phase is
      enriched in single bidirectional origins in NHF1-hTERT cells, followed by an
      increase in clustering during mid S phase and an increase in merging forks during
      late S phase. Early S phase in T98G cells also largely consisted of single
      bidirectional origin initiations; however, an increase in clustering was delayed 
      until an hour later, and clusters were shorter in mid/late S phase than in
      NHF1-hTERT cells. The spike in merging forks also did not occur until an hour
      later in T98G cells. Our observations suggest models to explain the temporal
      replication of single and clustered origins, and suggest differences in the
      replication program in a normal and cancer cell line.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab, alone and in combination with 
      irinotecan, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma in a phase II, multicenter,
      open-label, noncomparative trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven
      patients were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg alone or in
      combination with irinotecan 340 mg/m(2) or 125 mg/m(2) (with or without
      concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, respectively) once every 2
      weeks. Primary end points were 6-month progression-free survival and objective
      response rate, as determined by independent radiology review. Secondary end
      points included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: In the bevacizumab-alone
      and the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan groups, estimated 6-month progression-free
      survival rates were 42.6% and 50.3%, respectively; objective response rates were 
      28.2% and 37.8%, respectively; and median overall survival times were 9.2 months 
      and 8.7 months, respectively. There was a trend for patients who were taking
      corticosteroids at baseline to take stable or decreasing doses over time. Of the 
      patients treated with bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 46.4% and
      65.8%, respectively, experienced grade > or = 3 adverse events, the most common
      of which were hypertension (8.3%) and convulsion (6.0%) in the bevacizumab-alone 
      group and convulsion (13.9%), neutropenia (8.9%), and fatigue (8.9%) in the
      bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in two
      patients (2.4%) in the bevacizumab-alone group (grade 1) and in three patients
      (3.8%) patients in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group (grades 1, 2, and 4,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab, alone or in combination with irinotecan, 
      was well tolerated and active in recurrent glioblastoma.

TI  - A novel splice variant of GLI1 that promotes glioblastoma cell migration and
      invasion.
PG  - 6790-8
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0886 [doi]
AB  - The family of GLI zinc finger transcription factors regulates the expression of
      genes involved in many important cellular processes, notably embryonal
      development and cellular differentiation. The glioma-associated oncogene
      homologue 1 (GLI1) isoform, in particular, has attracted much attention because
      of its frequent activation in many human cancers and its interactions with other 
      signaling pathways, such as those mediated by K-RAS, transforming growth
      factor-beta, epidermal growth factor receptor, and protein kinase A. Here, we
      report the identification of a novel truncated GLI1 splice variant, tGLI1, with
      an in-frame deletion of 123 bases (41 codons) spanning the entire exon 3 and part
      of exon 4 of the GLI1 gene. Expression of tGLI1 is undetectable in normal cells
      but is high in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancer cells. Although
      tGLI1 undergoes nuclear translocalization and transactivates GLI1-binding sites
      similar to GLI1, unlike GLI1, it is associated with increased motility and
      invasiveness of GBM cells. Using microarray analysis, we showed >100 genes to be 
      differentially expressed in tGLI1-expressing compared with GLI1-expressing GBM
      cells, although both cell types expressed equal levels of known GLI1-regulated
      genes, such as PTCH1. We further showed one of the tGLI1 up-regulated genes,
      CD24, an invasion-associated gene, to be required for the migratory and invasive 
      phenotype of GBM cells. These data provide conclusive evidence for a novel
      gain-of-function GLI1 splice variant that promotes migration and invasiveness of 
      GBM cells and open up a new research paradigm on the role of the GLI1 pathway in 
      malignancy.

TI  - Quantification of extracellular UDP-galactose.
PG  - 23-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ab.2009.08.022 [doi]
AB  - The human P2Y(14) receptor is potently activated by UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc),
      UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), and UDP-glucuronic
      acid. Recently, cellular release of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc has been reported, but
      whether additional UDP-sugars are endogenous agonists for the P2Y(14) receptor
      remains poorly defined. In the present study, we describe an assay for the
      quantification of UDP-Gal with subnanomolar sensitivity. This assay is based on
      the enzymatic conversion of UDP-Gal to UDP, using 1-4-beta-galactosyltransferase.
      UDP is subsequently phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphokinase in the presence 
      of [gamma-(32)P]ATP and the formation of [gamma-(32)P]UTP is monitored by
      high-performance liquid chromatography. The overall conversion of UDP-Gal to
      [gamma-(32)P]UTP was linear between 0.5 and 30 nM UDP-Gal. Extracellular UDP-Gal 
      was detected on resting cultures of various cell types, and increased release of 
      UDP-Gal was observed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stimulated with the
      protease-activated receptor agonist thrombin. The occurrence of regulated release
      of UDP-Gal suggests that, in addition to its role in glycosylation reactions,
      UDP-Gal is an important extracellular signaling molecule.

TI  - Total-body cutaneous examination, total-body photography, and dermoscopy in the
      care of a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum and multiple melanomas.
PG  - 910-5
LID - 10.1001/archdermatol.2009.87 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disorder
      characterized by a defect in DNA repair and subsequent increased frequency of
      cutaneous malignant neoplasms, including melanoma. In patients with XP, patient
      and family education and aggressive UV radiation protection are the primary means
      of skin cancer prevention. An important secondary measure in decreasing morbidity
      and mortality in these patients involves early detection of skin cancers,
      particularly melanomas. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a 39-year-old woman with XP who
      developed 38 primary melanomas along with 6 squamous cell carcinomas and 70 basal
      cell carcinomas over a 23-year period. During this time, a 3-fold management
      approach of total-body cutaneous examination, total-body photography, and
      dermoscopy was used in the care of the patient. The thickest melanoma had a
      Breslow thickness of 1.07 mm, and the mean Breslow thickness of her detected
      melanomas was 0.18 mm. The ratio of benign to malignant biopsied suspicious
      melanocytic lesions during 23 years of follow-up was 0.9:1. All melanomas were
      treated using wide local excision, and she had no evidence of local or in-transit
      metastases of any of her malignant neoplasms at the most recent follow-up
      examination. Conclusion Monthly follow-up using total-body cutaneous
      examinations, total-body photography, and dermoscopy is an important 3-fold
      secondary management technique for this unique patient, allowing early detection 
      of her melanomas.

TI  - Conditional deletion of dnaic1 in a murine model of primary ciliary dyskinesia
      causes chronic rhinosinusitis.
PG  - 55-63
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2009-0118OC [doi]
AB  - Studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have been hampered by the lack of a
      suitable animal model because disruption of essential ciliary genes in mice
      results in a high incidence of lethal hydrocephalus. To develop a viable mouse
      model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in 
      which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1,
      are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of
      human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice
      have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase
      (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen
      results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of
      hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA,
      and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm
      structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary
      clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was
      observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6
      months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these
      tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the
      importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of
      lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that 
      other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways 
      of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and
      treatment of PCD.

TI  - Activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression and activity in the absence of
      germinal centers: insights into hyper-IgM syndrome.
PG  - 3237-48
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0901548 [doi]
AB  - Somatic hypermutation normally occurs as a consequence of the expression of
      activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) by Ag-activated, mature B cells
      during T cell-dependent germinal center responses. Nonetheless, despite their
      inability to express CD154 and initiate GC responses, patients with type 1
      hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM1) support populations of IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) B cells
      that express mutated Ig genes. The origin of these mutated B cells is unknown;
      the IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) cells do not express AID and appear to acquire mutations 
      independent of stringent selection by Ag. Here, we demonstrate that
      immature/transitional 1 B cells from the bone marrow of CD154-deficient mice
      express AID and acquire Ig mutations that lack the hallmarks of antigenic
      selection via BCR signaling. Comparable levels of AID expression was found in
      developmentally immature B cells recovered from murine fetal liver and from human
      immature/transitional 1 B cells recovered from umbilical cord blood. AID
      expression in human fetal liver was also robust, approaching that of human tonsil
      tissue and the human germinal center B cell line, Ramos. These observations led
      us to conclude that AID expression in developing human B cells is the origin of
      the mutated IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) B cells present in HIGM1 patients, and we propose
      that both mice and humans share a latent, AID-dependent pathway for the preimmune
      diversification of B lymphocytes that is more prominent in chicken, sheep, and
      rabbits.

AB  - The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) play
      central roles in the regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism,
      respectively. CaSR controls parathyroid hormone secretion and renal calcium
      reabsorption. Inactivating mutations of the CaSR result in conditions
      characterized by hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria, whereas activating lesions
      cause hypoparathyroidism and hypercalciuria. Calcimimetics are a group of
      agonists for the CaSR that have been shown to be powerful agents in the treatment
      of secondary hyperparathyroidism. FGF-23 acts on the kidney to inhibit the
      reabsorption of phosphate and the synthesis of 1,25(OH)(2)D. Disorders of
      increased FGF-23 function are associated with hypophosphatemia, inappropriately
      low 1,25(OH)(2)D levels, and either rickets or osteomalacia. Conversely,
      decreased FGF-23 activity results in hyperphosphatemia, increased 1,25(OH)(2)D
      levels, and abnormal soft-tissue calcification. In chronic kidney disease,
      increases in FGF-23 are being investigated as markers of disease progression.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sphingosine kinase is an oncogene that is up-regulated in several solid 
      tumors. The product of the sphingosine kinase activity, sphingosine-1-phosphate
      is a potent mitogen involved in diverse cell processes such as cell survival and 
      migration. Current standard therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM) is a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy using the drug
      temozolomide (TMZ). However, virtually all tumors become resistant to TMZ.
      Therefore, new drug targets are necessary. In this study, we investigated whether
      inhibiting sphingosine kinase could induce cell death in TMZ-resistant GBM cells.
      METHODS: To study TMZ resistance in vitro, we have generated TMZ-resistant cell
      lines from established GBM cells. We used a potent inhibitor of sphingosine
      kinase to study its effect on colony formation and cell growth in GBM cells with 
      a limited dilution and WST assay. Moreover, cell death was determined by
      measuring caspase-3 activity using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A sphingosine kinase 
      inhibitor reduced cell colony formation and activated caspase-3 in both
      TMZ-sensitive and resistant GBM cells. CONCLUSION: Addition of a sphingosine
      kinase inhibitor to the standard chemotherapy regimen against GBM may be
      beneficial.

PG  - 219-30

AB  - We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of erlotinib, a receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor, plus sirolimus, an
      inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, among patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma (GBM) in a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial. Thirty-two
      patients received daily erlotinib and sirolimus. The doses of erlotinib and
      sirolimus were 150 mg and 5 mg for patients not on concurrent CYP3A-inducing
      anti-epileptics (EIAEDS), and 450 mg and 10 mg for patients on EIAEDS.
      Evaluations were performed every two months. The primary endpoint was 6-month
      progression-free survival and secondary endpoints included safety and overall
      survival. Archival tumor samples were assessed for EGFR, EGFRvIII, PTEN, pAKT and
      pS6. Enrolled patients were heavily pre-treated including 53% who had received
      three or more prior chemotherapy agents and 28% who had received prior
      bevacizumab therapy. The most common grade > or = 2 adverse events were rash
      (59%), mucositis (34%) and diarrhea (31%). Grade 3 or higher events were rare.
      Best radiographic response included stable disease in 15 patients (47%); no
      patients achieved either a CR or PR. The estimated 6-month progression-free
      survival was 3.1% for all patients. Progression-free survival was better for
      patients not on EIAEDs (P = 0.03). Tumor markers failed to show an association
      with PFS except for increased pAKT expression which achieved borderline
      significance (P = 0.045). Although neither rash nor diarrhea had an association
      with outcome, hyperlipidemia was associated with longer PFS (P = 0.029).
      Erlotinib plus sirolimus was well tolerated but had negligible activity among
      unselected recurrent GBM patients. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT0062243).

AB  - Malignant gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) present some of the
      greatest challenges in the management of cancer patients worldwide, despite
      notable recent achievements in oncology. Even with aggressive surgical resections
      using state-of-the-art preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, along with
      recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients 
      remains dismal: median survival after diagnosis is about 14 months. Established
      good prognostic factors are limited, but include young age, high Karnofsky
      Performance Status (KPS), high mini-mental status examination score,
      O6-methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation, and resection of > 98%
      of the tumor. Standard treatment includes resection, followed by concurrent
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. GBM research is being conducted worldwide at a
      remarkable pace, with some of the more recent promising studies focused on
      identification of aberrant genetic events and signaling pathways, tumor stem cell
      identification and characterization, modulation of tumor immunological responses,
      combination therapies, and understanding of the rare long-term survivors. Past
      treatment strategies have failed for various reasons; however, newer strategies
      in trials today and on the horizon encourage optimism. To help illustrate 'where 
      we have been' with this fatal disease and 'where we are going' with contemporary 
      studies, we include in this review a detailed history of Phase III clinical
      trials for GBM, with a final emphasis on exciting new treatment strategies that
      offer hope for future GBM therapy.

TI  - Analysis of claudin genes in pediatric patients with Bartter's syndrome.
PG  - 126-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04031.x [doi]
AB  - Bartter's syndrome is a constellation of symptoms characterized by
      hyper-reninemic hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin and aldosterone,
      low or normal blood pressure, and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
      So far, five gene mutations in proteins regulating the sodium chloride transport 
      in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop have been described. However, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying the presentation of hypomagnesemia in some of
      these patients remains unclear. Claudins are a family of transmembranous proteins
      within the tight junctions that have been shown to be important for the
      paracellular movement of ions. Mutations in claudin-16 have been identified in
      patients with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.
      To test the hypothesis that mutations in claudin genes may be involved in the
      altered magnesium and calcium transport in Bartter's syndrome, we began to
      examine the genes of claudins known to be present in renal tubules in four
      pediatric patients with Bartter's syndrome. All four patients were African
      Americans with hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria. In this study, we did not find 
      any mutation in the coding regions of claudin-2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -10, -11, or -16
      genes in these patients. However, all patients had a single nucleotide
      substitution of C for T at the position of 451 of claudin-8 gene sequence that
      changes amino acid residue from serine to proline at the position of 151 in the
      second extracellular domain of claudin-8 protein. The significance of this known 
      single nucleotide polymorphism remains to be determined.

TI  - Phase II trial of temozolomide (TMZ) plus irinotecan (CPT-11) in adults with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme before radiotherapy.
PG  - 393-400
LID - 10.1007/s11060-009-9937-x [doi]
AB  - This phase II trial evaluated efficacy and safety of temozolomide (TMZ) in
      combination with irinotecan (CPT-11) before radiotherapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Prior to radiotherapy, patients were
      treated with a maximum of three 6-week cycles of TMZ and CPT-11. Patients
      received TMZ at a dose of 200 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and CPT-11 on days 1, 8,
      22, and 29, with a dose adjustment for enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug use.
      The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points
      included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and
      tumor O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Of the 42
      patients treated, 8 (19%) patients achieved a partial response. Median PFS and
      median OS were 3.1 and 13.8 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were
      documented in 36% of patients, most of which were hematologic (29%). Twenty-four 
      percent of patients had grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic AEs, with gastrointestinal
      AEs being the most common (12%) Two patients died, one of intracranial hemorrhage
      and one of treatment-related renal failure. Low MGMT expression, compared with
      high MGMT expression, showed no significant difference in ORR (25 vs. 8%), median
      PFS (14 vs. 5 months) or OS (21 vs. 15 months). Although TMZ plus CPT-11 is at
      least comparable in efficacy to TMZ alone, this combination appears more toxic
      and poorly tolerated. The lack of correlation of activity with MGMT expression is
      intriguing, but needs further evaluation in subsequent trials.

AB  - Head and lateral line erosion (HLLE) is a chronic dermatopathy affecting a number
      of fish that presents as depigmented skin along the lateral line system of the
      trunk and head. We present microbiological, immunological and histopathological
      features of this lesion in channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque),
      that developed after exposure to a chronic nutritional stress. Depigmention was
      limited to skin that was adjacent to the lateral line. The epidermis of affected 
      fish was thin and reduced to a one-cell-thick layer over the lateral line.
      Melanocytes were depleted at the dermo-epidermal junction and formed aggregates
      in the epidermis. Innate immunity was weaker in affected fish than that
      previously measured in well-fed channel catfish. Because the pathology and
      apparent aetiology of HLLE described in various fish species are highly variable,
      HLLE appears to be a clinical sign, rather than a disease or syndrome. Thus, we
      propose that this clinical sign be referred to as lateral line depigmentation
      (LLD), because this description more accurately encompasses all cases of this
      presentation reported in fish. As nutritional requirements of channel catfish and
      lateral line neuroanatomy are well-known, the ability to reproducibly induce LLD 
      in this species could provide a useful model for understanding its pathogenesis.

TI  - An evaluation of the effect of a topical product containing C-xyloside and
      blueberry extract on the appearance of type II diabetic skin.
PG  - 147-51
LID - 10.1111/j.1473-2165.2009.00428.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a multisystem disease caused by the presence of chronic
      hyperglycemia, which leads to increased oxidative stress. Many of the changes
      observed in type II diabetic patients can be traced to the increased production
      of advanced glycation end products, also known as AGEs. AGEs are produced as a
      result of a nonenzymatic reaction with glucose interacting with proteins, lipids,
      and nucleic acids. AGEs are also present in normal skin with advancing age and
      contribute to the senescence of many body organs, including the skin. AIMS: This 
      research evaluated the effect of a topical product formulation containing
      blueberry extract, an AGE inhibitor, and C-xyloside, a GAG synthesis stimulator, 
      applied twice daily on the hand, arm, and facial skin of 20 type II diabetic
      females. Diabetic skin was chosen for evaluation because AGEs are found in
      increased concentration in diabetic skin, representing a model for accelerated
      aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center study enrolled 20 female type II
      diabetics aged 55+ years with mild to moderate fine lines, wrinkles, and
      hyperpigmentation on the face and hands. Subjects used the study product on their
      face, hand, and inner forearm twice daily for 12 weeks. Ordinal grading on a
      4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 =moderate, 3 = severe) of facial fine lines,
      wrinkles, firmness, radiance, skin tone, skin smoothness, hyperpigmentation,
      creping, density, sagging, and overall appearance was performed by the
      investigator at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. Tolerability, subject
      assessments, digital photography, AGE measurements, skin caliper measurements,
      and corneometry were also performed at each time point. RESULTS: 19/20 subjects
      successfully completed the study. The presence of AGEs was documented by skin
      autofluorescence. The 12-week duration of the study was insufficient to measure a
      change in skin AGEs, but longer application of the study product might produce
      different results. No tolerability issues were noted. There was a statistically
      significant increase in skin caliper measurements on the face (P = 0.004) and arm
      (P = 0.014) as well as corneometry measurements (P < 0.001) consistent with
      enhanced moisturization at week 12. The dermatologist investigator also found
      statistically significant improvement in fine lines (P = 0.01), firmness (P =
      0.011), radiance (P < 0.001), skin tone (P = 0.014), skin smoothness (P < 0.001),
      creping (P < 0.004), and overall appearance (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study
      examined a topical product containing an AGE inhibitor and a GAG synthesis
      stimulator designed for the unique needs of diabetic skin.

PG  - 501-13
LID - 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastomas are lethal cancers characterized by florid angiogenesis promoted in
      part by glioma stem cells (GSCs). Because hypoxia regulates angiogenesis, we
      examined hypoxic responses in GSCs. We now demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible
      factor HIF2alpha and multiple HIF-regulated genes are preferentially expressed in
      GSCs in comparison to non-stem tumor cells and normal neural progenitors. In
      tumor specimens, HIF2alpha colocalizes with cancer stem cell markers. Targeting
      HIFs in GSCs inhibits self-renewal, proliferation, and survival in vitro, and
      attenuates tumor initiation potential of GSCs in vivo. Analysis of a molecular
      database reveals that HIF2A expression correlates with poor glioma patient
      survival. Our results demonstrate that GSCs differentially respond to hypoxia
      with distinct HIF induction patterns, and HIF2alpha might represent a promising
      target for antiglioblastoma therapies.

TI  - Tinzaparin prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic complications in brain tumor
      patients.
PG  - 129-134
LID - 10.1007/s11060-009-9911-7 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of tinzaparin for deep vein
      thrombosis prophylaxis in newly diagnosed grade III-IV malignant glioma patients.
      Patients were initiated on daily tinzaparin at a fixed dose of 4,500 IU
      subcutaneously between 48 h and 4 weeks post-operative for planned duration of 12
      months. During chemotherapy cycles, blood counts were monitored weekly and
      tinzaparin was held if the platelet count decreased to <50,000 and was
      re-initiated at a platelet count >100,000. Forty patients were enrolled into the 
      study, 35 with glioblastoma multiforme and 5 with anaplastic astrocytoma.
      Possible attributable toxicity was limited to two patients who developed CNS
      hemorrhages (one grade 1 and one grade 2) and one patient with an increase in
      liver enzymes (grade 3). There were no patients with a grade 4 or 5 CNS
      hemorrhages or systemic hemorrhages >or=grade 2. The median time on prophylactic 
      tinzaparin was 161 days (range of 5 to 601 days). One patient developed a deep
      venous thrombosis while taking tinzaparin, and three patients developed
      thromboembolic complications while off tinzaparin. Tinzaparin at a fixed
      prophylactic dose is safe and may decrease the incidence of thromboembolic
      complications in brain tumor patients.

PG  - 701-18
LID - 10.1517/14728220902942348 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma is the commonest primary brain tumor, as well as the deadliest.
      Malignant gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) present some of the
      greatest challenges in the management of cancer patients worldwide, despite
      notable recent achievements in oncology. Even with aggressive surgical resections
      using state-of-the-art preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, along with
      recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients 
      remains dismal: survival after diagnosis is about 1 year. Established prognostic 
      factors are limited, but include age, Karnofsky performance status, mini-mental
      status examination score, O6-methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation
      and extent of surgery. Standard treatment includes resection of > 95% of the
      tumor, followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Nevertheless, GBM
      research is being conducted worldwide at a remarkable pace, in the laboratory and
      at the bedside, with some of the more recent promising studies focused on
      identification of aberrant genetic events and signaling pathways to develop
      molecular-based targeted therapies, tumor stem cell identification and
      characterization, modulation of tumor immunological responses and understanding
      of the rare long-term survivors. With this universally fatal disease, any small
      breakthrough will have a significant impact on survival and provide hope to the
      thousands of patients who receive this diagnosis annually. This review describes 
      the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathology and tumor immunology, with a
      focus on understanding the molecular biology that underlies the current targeted 
      therapeutics being tested.

TI  - Total dietary antioxidant index and survival in patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1007/s10552-009-9338-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of antioxidants in survival of cancer patients is
      controversial. No data on the relationships between antioxidant intake and
      survival of glioma patients are available. Our objective was to examine such
      association in a large series of cases. METHODS: The study population includes
      814 glioblastoma multiforme cases that were newly diagnosed, histologically
      confirmed, aged 20 or older, and residing in the San Francisco Bay Area at
      diagnosis. Cases were identified via the regional cancer registry's rapid case
      ascertainment system during 1991-1994 (series I), 1997-2000 (series II), and
      2001-2004 (series III). Daily dietary antioxidant intake at diagnosis was
      assessed via food-frequency questionnaire and was expressed as total antioxidant 
      index, calculated based on Trolox equivalent per gram of food. In addition, the
      study collected information on supplements/vitamin intake. RESULTS: Overall, our 
      results indicated no consistent, significant association of survival with dietary
      antioxidant intake or its combination with vitamin supplements. However, in
      series III, we observed a significant association between higher antioxidant
      index and better survival: HR = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.74) for each unit of
      antioxidant index on a log-scale. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is possible that this 
      is a chance finding, the association between dietary antioxidants and survival in
      the most recently recruited patients warrants further investigations.

TI  - Primary ciliary dyskinesia: improving the diagnostic approach.
PG  - 320-5
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e328329cddb [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) has relied
      on analysis of ciliary motility and ultrastructure; however, these tests are not 
      readily available and have not been standardized. Consequently, the diagnosis of 
      PCD may be delayed or missed or made incorrectly. This review outlines the
      potential utility of new diagnostic tests, including measurement of nasal nitric 
      oxide production and systematic analysis for mutations in genes encoding ciliary 
      proteins. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical manifestations of PCD have been expanded to
      include neonatal respiratory distress and heterotaxy. Measurement of nasal nitric
      oxide has emerged as a useful screening test for PCD based on the very low levels
      in PCD (approximately 1/10 of normal values). Genetic testing is emerging for PCD
      and demonstrates extensive genetic heterogeneity. Some genes and gene mutations
      involved in PCD have been defined. Approximately one-third of PCD cases have
      identifiable gene mutations in one of six different genes. An international
      effort is focused on defining PCD-causing defects in other genes. SUMMARY: The
      incorporation of nasal nitric oxide measurement as a screening test to define
      probable PCD cases and gene mutation analysis to make a definitive diagnosis of
      PCD should enhance diagnostic evaluation of PCD.

TI  - Successful kidney transplantation from a donation after cardiac death donor with 
      acute renal failure and bowel infarction using extracorporeal support.
PG  - 798-804

AB  - As a result of the ever widening disparity between organ supply and demand, a
      resurgence of interest has occurred in kidney recovery from donation after
      cardiac death (DCD) donors. New techniques of in situ extracorporeal support
      offer the potential to reduce warm ischemic injury and optimize donor management 
      prior to organ recovery. In addition, preliminary outcomes using kidneys from
      selected deceased donors with rising serum creatinine levels have been promising.
      However, contraindications to successful organ donation and transplantation may
      include the presence of abdominal compartment syndrome, generalized bowel
      infarction, refractory shock with profound metabolic and lactic acidosis, and
      acute anuric renal failure, particularly in the setting of DCD. We report herein 
      the successful recovery and transplantation of kidneys from an unstable donor
      with the above constellation of conditions in the setting of extracorporeal
      support after declaration of death by asystole.

TI  - Posterior fossa neoplasm and PHACES syndrome: a case report.
PG  - 203-5
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181983b15 [doi]
AB  - A 4-year-old girl with PHACES syndrome (posterior fossa brain malformations,
      hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, cardiac anomalies/coarctation of the aorta, eye 
      abnormalities, and sternal clefting/supraumbilical raphe) developed a cerebellar 
      pilocytic astrocytoma 18 months after resolution of her neck, ear, and thoracic
      hemangiomas. Because cutaneous hemangiomas may have involuted by the time a
      patient is diagnosed with a central nervous system neoplasm, it seems possible
      that in other such patients the association may have gone unrecognized.
      Cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma may be a rare manifestation of the posterior
      fossa malformations of PHACES.

TI  - Liver disease in pregnancy.
PG  - 897-906
AB  - Liver diseases in pregnancy may be categorized into liver disorders that occur
      only in the setting of pregnancy and liver diseases that occur coincidentally
      with pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia/eclampsia, syndrome of
      hemolysis, elevated liver tests and low platelets (HELLP), acute fatty liver of
      pregnancy, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are pregnancy-specific
      disorders that may cause elevations in liver tests and hepatic dysfunction.
      Chronic liver diseases, including cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune
      hepatitis, Wilson disease, and viral hepatitis may also be seen in pregnancy.
      Management of liver disease in pregnancy requires collaboration between
      obstetricians and gastroenterologists/hepatologists. Treatment of
      pregnancy-specific liver disorders usually involves delivery of the fetus and
      supportive care, whereas management of chronic liver disease in pregnancy is
      directed toward optimizing control of the liver disorder. Cirrhosis in the
      setting of pregnancy is less commonly observed but offers unique challenges for
      patients and practitioners. This article reviews the epidemiology,
      pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of liver diseases seen in pregnancy.

AB  - Published data on the epidemiology of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
      among adults are very limited. We conducted a study of ITP incidence using the
      General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom. From 1992 to 2005,
      there were 840 cases of ITP among adults considering 21 749 623 person-years
      (PYs) of follow-up, for a crude incidence of 3.9 per 100 000 PYs [95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 3.6, 4.1]. The incidence was higher among women [4.5 per 100 000
      PYs (95% CI: 4.2, 4.9)] than men [3.2 per 100 000 PYs (95% CI: 2.8, 3.5)]. Among 
      both women and men, incidence was higher at older ages and in later study years. 
      In a systematic review of previously published literature, incidence of ITP among
      adults ranged from 1.6 to 2.68 per 100 000 persons per year; prevalence ranged
      from 9.5 to 23.6 per 100 000 persons. In order to improve the understanding of
      the disease burden of ITP, future studies should include a clearly defined
      definition of ITP and focus on well-described source populations that are
      geographically and ethnically diverse.

AB  - SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening 
      thrombotic illness caused by drug-dependent antibodies recognizing complexes of
      platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. Little is known about the immune
      pathogenesis of HIT, in particular factors influencing PF4/heparin antibody
      formation. To gain insight into the biologic basis of heparin sensitization, we
      have recently developed an animal model using wild-type (WT) mice in which murine
      PF4/heparin antibodies (anti-mPF4/H) arise de novo after antigen challenge.
      OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This report describes technical refinements to the murine
      model and describes additional biologic features of the immune response to
      mPF4/heparin. RESULTS: Our studies indicate that antibody responses to
      mPF4/heparin are dependent on murine strain, injection routes and doses of mPF4
      and heparin. C57BL/6 mice are more immunologically responsive to mPF4/heparin
      antigen than BALB/c mice and robust immunization can be achieved with
      intravenous, but not intraperitoneal, administration of antigen. We also observe 
      a direct relationship between initial concentrations of mPF4 and antibody levels.
      Additionally, we demonstrate that mPF4/H immune response in mice decays with
      time, is not associated with thrombocytopenia and displays characteristics of
      immune recall on re-exposure to antigen. CONCLUSIONS: These studies describe and 
      characterize a murine model for studying the immunologic basis of PF4/heparin
      sensitization.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor in
      adults, is associated with high mortality. Current standard-of-care treatments,
      including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, offer only palliation. Recent
      research in cancer therapy has shifted towards targeting the specific molecular
      aberrations that underlie the pathogenesis of cancers including GBM. Protein
      kinases are a family of enzymes that are key components in regulating cellular
      homeostasis. Protein kinases can be deregulated by several mechanisms, which
      contribute to cancer initiation and maintenance. Several protein kinases are
      important in gliomagenesis, thus representing new therapeutic targets in GBM. Low
      molecular weight inhibitors are the most commonly used agents to target protein
      kinases in the treatment of cancers. However, first-generation kinase inhibitors 
      targeting only single kinases have demonstrated limited efficacy in unselected
      GBM patient populations. Several mechanisms of failure of monotherapy with
      single-targeted kinase inhibitors have been explained as new therapeutic
      strategies have emerged to overcome resistance. Simultaneous disruption of
      several kinases can be achieved by either multitargeted kinase inhibitors or
      combination of single-targeted kinase inhibitors with one another or with
      traditional cytotoxics. In this review, we will discuss the current clinical
      status of targeted therapy in GBM and recent approaches to target multiple
      kinases in this devastating cancer.

TI  - IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in gliomas.
PG  - 765-73
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa0808710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent genomewide mutational analysis of glioblastomas (World
      Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) revealed somatic mutations of the
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) in a fraction of such tumors, most
      frequently in tumors that were known to have evolved from lower-grade gliomas
      (secondary glioblastomas). METHODS: We determined the sequence of the IDH1 gene
      and the related IDH2 gene in 445 central nervous system (CNS) tumors and 494
      non-CNS tumors. The enzymatic activity of the proteins that were produced from
      normal and mutant IDH1 and IDH2 genes was determined in cultured glioma cells
      that were transfected with these genes. RESULTS: We identified mutations that
      affected amino acid 132 of IDH1 in more than 70% of WHO grade II and III
      astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and in glioblastomas that developed from
      these lower-grade lesions. Tumors without mutations in IDH1 often had mutations
      affecting the analogous amino acid (R172) of the IDH2 gene. Tumors with IDH1 or
      IDH2 mutations had distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients
      with such tumors had a better outcome than those with wild-type IDH genes. Each
      of four tested IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduced the enzymatic activity of the
      encoded protein. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate
      dehydrogenases encoded by IDH1 and IDH2 occur in a majority of several types of
      malignant gliomas.

TI  - What is your diagnosis? Abdominal mass aspirate in a cat with an increased Na:K
      ratio.

AB  - A 13-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented for evaluation of pollakiuria.
      Laboratory abnormalities included mild hypercholesterolemia, moderate
      hypertriglyceridemia, and a mild increase in the Na:K ratio (43, reference
      interval 32-41). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed urinary calculi and a soft
      tissue mass between the right caudate liver lobe and the right kidney. Surgery
      was done to remove the cystic calculi, and aspirates of the mass were obtained.
      Cytologic specimens contained a population of large, round to angular cells with 
      round nuclei, coarse irregularly stippled chromatin, 1-2 prominent round to
      angular nucleoli, and abundant pale basophilic cytoplasm distended by numerous
      well-delineated vacuoles. Rare binucleated cells and micronuclei, and moderate
      anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, and anisonucleoleosis were noted. The cytologic
      interpretation was adrenal neoplasia, consistent with adrenal carcinoma.
      Approximately 4 months later, the cat developed vomiting, dehydration, weakness, 
      and cervical ventroflexion. Serum biochemical alterations at that time included
      marked hypokalemia (2.4 mmol/L, reference interval 3.4-5.6 mmol/L) and a markedly
      increased Na:K ratio (65, reference interval 32-41). Mean systolic blood pressure
      was 205 mmHg. Surgical removal of the mass was accomplished via right
      adrenalectomy and a diagnosis of adrenal carcinoma was confirmed histologically. 
      Plasma aldosterone concentration (measured preoperatively) was 1358 pmol/L
      (reference interval 194-388 pmol/L). Primary hyperaldosteronism caused by a
      functional adrenal carcinoma is an uncommon condition in cats.

TI  - Pulsed arterial spin-labeled MR imaging evaluation of tuberous sclerosis.
PG  - 815-20
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A1428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tuberous sclerosis presents with characteristic cortical 
      hamartomas and subependymal nodules associated with seizures. The purpose of this
      study was to use pulsed arterial spin-labeling (PASL) to quantify the perfusion
      of the cortical hamartomas and correlate the perfusion values with seizure
      frequency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective search yielded 16 MR imaging
      examinations including conventional MR imaging and PASL perfusion performed in 13
      patients (age range, 7 months to 23 years) with a history of tuberous sclerosis. 
      The mean perfusion of each cortical hamartoma greater than 5 mm in size localized
      with conventional MR imaging sequences was obtained with use of manually drawn
      regions of interest. Cortical hamartomas were classified as normal,
      hyperperfused, or hypoperfused on the basis of the mean and SD of the unaffected 
      cortex. Correlation was made between perfusion imaging, conventional imaging, and
      clinical history. RESULTS: Of the 245 cortical hamartomas, 227 (92.7%) were
      hypoperfused, 10 (4.1%) were hyperperfused, and 8 (3.3%) were unchanged relative 
      to the mean gray matter. One patient had a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
      with a mean perfusion of 93.5 mL/100 g tissue/min. There was a statistically
      significant positive correlation between seizure frequency and the number of
      hyperperfused cortical tubers (r = 0.51; n = 16; P = .04), with higher seizure
      frequency associated with a greater number of hyperperfused cortical tubers.
      There was no significant correlation, however, between seizure frequency and the 
      overall number of cortical tubers (r = 0.20; n = 16; P = .47). CONCLUSIONS: The
      PASL technique can assess and quantify the perfusion characteristics of a
      cortical hamartoma. Most lesions are hypoperfused; however, both normally
      perfused and hyperperfused lesions occur. The presence of hyperperfused cortical 
      tubers was associated with increased seizure frequency.

TI  - LLL-3 inhibits STAT3 activity, suppresses glioblastoma cell growth and prolongs
      survival in a mouse glioblastoma model.
PG  - 106-12
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604793 [doi]
AB  - Persistent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
      (STAT3) signalling has been linked to oncogenesis and the development of
      chemotherapy resistance in glioblastoma and other cancers. Inhibition of the
      STAT3 pathway thus represents an attractive therapeutic approach for cancer. In
      this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of a small molecule compound
      known as LLL-3, which is a structural analogue of the earlier reported STAT3
      inhibitor, STA-21, on the cell viability of human glioblastoma cells, U87, U373, 
      and U251 expressing constitutively activated STAT3. We also investigated the
      inhibitory effects of LLL-3 on U87 glioblastoma cell growth in a mouse tumour
      model as well as the impact it had on the survival time of the treated mice. We
      observed that LLL-3 inhibited STAT3-dependent transcriptional and DNA binding
      activities. LLL-3 also inhibited viability of U87, U373, and U251 glioblastoma
      cells as well as induced apoptosis of these glioblastoma cell lines as evidenced 
      by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 cleavages.
      Furthermore, the U87 glioblastoma tumour-bearing mice treated with LLL-3
      exhibited prolonged survival relative to vehicle-treated mice (28.5 vs 16 days)
      and had smaller intracranial tumours and no evidence of contralateral invasion.
      These results suggest that LLL-3 may be a potential therapeutic agent in the
      treatment of glioblastoma with constitutive STAT3 activation.

      & lower jaws and their possible mechanism, & relatively long term disappearance
      of pain & cancer parameters by one optimal dose of DHEA, Astragalus, Boswellia
      Serrata, often with press needle stimulation of True ST. 36.
PG  - 175-203
AB  - One minute downward pressure on the tip of any one of the front 3 teeth (1st
      incisor, 2nd incisor, and canine) at the right and left sides of the upper and
      lower jaw by a wooden toothpick induced temporary disappearance (20 min
      approximately 4 hours) of abnormally increased pain parameters (pain grading,
      Substance P, & TXB2), and cancer parameters (Telomere, Integrin alpha5beta1,
      Oncogene C-fos Ab2, etc. of Astrocytoma, Glioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma of
      esophagus, adenocarcinoma of lung, breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of colon,
      prostate cancer). The effect included temporary disappearance of headache,
      toothache, chest and abdominal pain, and backache, often with improved memory &
      concentration. Since these beneficial changes resembled the effects of giving one
      optimal dose of DHEA, increase of DHEA was measured. Above mechanical stimulation
      of one of these front teeth increased abnormally reduced DHEA levels of less than
      10 ng to norm1 100 approximately 130 ng BDORT units and normal cell (NC)
      telomeres from markedly reduced values to near normal values, and improved
      acetylcholine in the Hippocampus. Large organ representation areas for the
      Adrenal gland & Hippocampus may exist at these front teeth. This method can be
      used for emergency pain control and can explain the beneficial effect of bruxism 
      and tooth brushing, through the increase of DHEA levels and activities of the
      Hippocampus by increasing Acetylcholine. Increasing NC telomere to optimally high
      level resulted in disappearance of pain and improvement or significant reduction 
      of malignant tumor. Repeated daily press needle stimulation of True ST. 36
      increased NC telomere 450-700 ng BDORT units. One optimal dose of DHEA increased 
      NC telomere 525 ng DBORT units and eliminated the pain and abnormally increased
      cancer parameters; effect of one optimal dose lasted 0.5-11 months. One optimal
      dose of Boswellia Serrata or Astragalus not only increased NC telomere 650 ng
      BDORT units, eliminating pain and cancer parameters, but also reduced the size of
      the Astrocytoma grade I by 10-20% and the Glioblastoma by 15-90% in less than 2-6
      months in some patients, as long as high NC telomere is maintained.

TI  - Recurrent infantile myofibromatosis: a report of conservative management and
      discussion of treatment strategies.
PG  - E4
AB  - Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare proliferative mesenchymal disorder that has a
      potential for rapid growth and recurrence. Approximately 30% of infantile
      myofibromatosis lesions present in the head and neck, and some of these can cause
      significant morbidity. We report a case of recurrent infantile myofibromatosis
      that persisted after surgery and chemotherapy and was managed conservatively.
      Treatment of infantile myofibromatosis varies according to the size, location,
      and extent of disease. Solitary lesions may be simply observed in view of their
      potential for regression, but surgical excision, radiotherapy, and/or
      chemotherapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially for
      nonresectable, rapidly progressive, or symptomatic lesions.

TI  - Computerized assessment of vessel morphological changes during treatment of
      glioblastoma multiforme: report of a case imaged serially by MRA over four years.
PG  - T143-51
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.10.067 [doi]
AB  - A patient with glioblastoma multiforme underwent serial computerized analysis of 
      tumor-associated vasculature defined from magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA)
      scans obtained over almost a four year period. The clinical course included tumor
      resection with subsequent radiation therapy, a long symptom-free interval,
      emergence of a new malignant focus, resection of that focus, a stroke, and
      treatment with chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. Image analysis methods
      included segmentation of vessels from each MRA and statistical comparison of
      vessel morphology over 4 regions of interest (the initial tumor site, the second 
      tumor site, a distant control region, and the entire brain) to the same 4 regions
      of interest in 50 healthy volunteers (26 females and 24 males; mean age 39
      years). Results suggested that following completion of focal radiation therapy
      (RT) vessel shape abnormalities, if elevated at the time of RT completion, may
      progressively normalize for months in focal regions, that progressively severe
      vessel shape abnormalities can precede the emergence of a gadolinium enhancing
      lesion by months, that lesion resection can produce a dramatic but highly
      transient drop in abnormal vessel tortuosity both focally and globally, and that 
      treatment with anti-angiogenic agents does not necessarily normalize vessel
      shape. Quantitative measurements of vessel morphology as defined from MRA may
      provide useful insights into tumor development and response to therapy.

AB  - Complete DiGeorge anomaly is characterized by athymia, congenital heart disease, 
      and hypoparathyroidism. This congenital disease is fatal by age 2 years unless
      immune reconstitution is successful. There are multiple underlying syndromes
      associated with complete DiGeorge anomaly including 22q11 hemizygosity in
      approximately 50%, CHARGE association in approximately 25%, and diabetic
      embryopathy in approximately 15%. Approximately one-third of patients present
      with rash and lymphadenopathy associated with oligoclonal "host" T cells. This
      condition resembles Omenn syndrome. Immunosuppression is necessary to control the
      oligoclonal T cells. The results of thymus transplantation are reported for a
      series of 50 patients, of whom 36 survive. The survivors develop naive T cells
      and a diverse T cell repertoire.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between gender, history of cranial radiation
      therapy (CRT) and facial expression recognition (FER) skill in survivors of
      pediatric brain tumors. METHODS: Fifty-three survivors (27 females) completed a
      measure of FER and an intelligence test. RESULTS: There was a significant
      interaction between gender and CRT on ability to interpret low-intensity facial
      expressions, such that females who had not had CRT made fewer errors than either 
      females who had CRT or males. CONCLUSION: A history of CRT has a notable effect
      on FER skill in females: girls who received CRT performed significantly more
      poorly than girls who did not.

TI  - Gastroschisis, atresia, dysmotility: surgical treatment strategies for a distinct
      clinical entity.
PG  - 2208-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.08.065 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Intestinal atresia (IA) occurs in 10% to 20% of infants born with
      gastroschisis (GS). We describe a distinct subset of these children with severe
      dysmotility, without mechanical intestinal obstruction, and with adequate
      intestinal length for enteral nutrition and propose possible treatment
      strategies. METHODS: A total of 177 patients with GS managed at a single
      institution between 1993 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:
      Twenty-one (12%) patients had IA. Six (29%) did well, with gradual progression to
      full diet; 1 died at birth because of complete midgut infarction; 1 died of
      necrotizing enterocolitis; 4 with short bowel syndrome (SBS) (small bowel length,
      30-41 cm) died of liver failure because of total parenteral nutrition (3) or
      sepsis (1). Nine (43%) were felt to have gastroschisis/atresia/dysmotility,
      defined as adequate small bowel length for survival as measured at time of
      laparotomy (mean, 146 cm; range, 66-233 cm), massive intestinal dilatation, and
      stasis. Of 9 patients with gastroschisis/atresia/dysmotility, 5 (56%) survived.
      All had surgery to "rescue" their dysfunction intestine, at mean age 128 days
      (range, 52-271 days): 4 had tapering enteroplasties of mean 37 cm (range, 5-115
      cm)-all 4 survived; 3 had diverting stomas created for intestinal decompression, 
      followed by stoma closure-1 survived; 1 nonsurvivor had a Kimura "patch"; 1
      nonsurvivor underwent redo anastomosis. Survivors weaned off total parenteral
      nutrition at mean age 331 days after rescue surgery (range, 42-814 days).
      CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of patients with GS/IA appear to have
      significant intestinal dysmotility without true SBS nor obstruction. Successful
      treatment of these infants may be achieved with the use of tapering enteroplasty 
      and/or temporary diverting stomas.

TI  - Sustained attention in children with two etiologies of early hydrocephalus.
PG  - 765-75
LID - 10.1037/a0013373 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown that children with spina bifida meningomyelocele (SBM)
      and hydrocephalus have attention problems on parent ratings and difficulties in
      stimulus orienting associated with a posterior brain attention system. Less is
      known about response control and inhibition associated with an anterior brain
      attention system. Using the Gordon Vigilance Task (Gordon, 1983), we studied
      error rate, reaction time, and performance over time for sustained attention, a
      key anterior attention function, in 101 children with SBM, 17 with aqueductal
      stenosis (AS; another condition involving congenital hydrocephalus), and 40
      typically developing controls (NC). In SBM, we investigated the relation between 
      cognitive attention and parent ratings of inattention and hyperactivity and
      explored the impact of medical variables. Children with SBM did not differ from
      AS or NC groups on measures of sustained attention, but they committed more
      errors and responded more slowly. Approximately one-third of the SBM group had
      attention symptoms, although parent attention ratings were not associated with
      task performance. Hydrocephalus does not account for the attention profile of
      children with SBM, which also reflects the distinctive brain dysmorphologies
      associated with this condition.

LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1085463 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this population-based study is to investigate IQ and IQ-related
      factors in children with hydrocephalus (HC). Psychometric intelligence was
      assessed in subjects below the age of 7.3 years (N=52, F=18, M=34) with the
      Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised (WPPSI-R) and for 
      children above the age of 7.3 years (N=29, F=6, M=23) with the Wechsler
      Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised (WISC-R). The controls were matched
      according to age, gender, and geographic variables. All children were living in
      western Norway. 57 children had infantile HC (IH) and 24 had childhood HC (CH).
      Children with myelomeningocele (MMC), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or
      intracranial tumours were excluded. IQ levels were found to be significantly
      higher in the control group than in the HC groups. The Kaufman factors showed a
      similar pattern, with lowest values in IH, and CH intermediate between IH and NC.
      The results demonstrate that HC affects IQ. More specific cognitive profiles,
      such as non-verbal learning disabilities, are not detectable when using the
      Wechsler tests. For this purpose, other tests and models for analyses may be
      recommended.

TI  - Randomized phase II study of cilengitide, an integrin-targeting
      arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide, in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 5610-7
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.7510 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin
      receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range
      of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a
      prior phase I study. The current multicenter phase II study was conducted to
      evaluate the activity and safety of cilengitide in GBM patients at first
      recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to
      receive either 500 or 2,000 mg of cilengitide twice weekly on a continuous basis.
      Patients were assessed every 4 weeks. The primary end point was 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary end points included PFS, overall 
      survival (OS), and radiographic response, as well as quality-of-life and
      pharmacokinetic assessments. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were enrolled,
      including 41 on the 500-mg arm and 40 on the 2,000-mg arm. The safety profile of 
      cilengitide was excellent, with no significant reproducible toxicities observed
      on either arm. Antitumor activity was observed in both treatment cohorts but
      trended more favorably among patients treated with 2,000 mg, including a 6-month 
      PFS of 15% and a median OS of 9.9 months. CONCLUSION: Cilengitide monotherapy is 
      well tolerated and exhibits modest antitumor activity among recurrent GBM
      patients. Additional studies integrating cilengitide into combinatorial regimens 
      for GBM are warranted.

TI  - Protein- and DNA-based active immunotherapy targeting interleukin-13 receptor
      alpha2.
PG  - 581-9
LID - 10.1089/cbr.2008.0462 [doi]
AB  - High-grade astrocytoma (HGA) is an invariably fatal malignancy with a mean
      survival of 14 months despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. We have found
      that a restricted receptor for interleukin-13 (IL-13), IL-13 receptor alpha 2
      (IL13Ralpha2), is abundantly overexpressed in the vast majority of HGAs but is
      not appreciably expressed in normal tissue, with the exception of the testes.
      Therefore, IL-13Ralpha2 is a very attractive target for anti-HGA immunotherapy.
      In order to test protein and genetic vaccines that target IL13Ralpha2, we
      developed a G26-IL13Ralpha2-expressing syngeneic immunocompetent murine glioma
      model. Using this glioma model, mice were immunized with recombinant
      extracellular IL13Ralpha2 protein (IL13Ralpha2ex) or a DNA expression vector
      containing the gene for IL13Ralpha2 and were subsequently challenged with
      IL13Ralpha2( + ) G26 tumors. Mice immunized with either recombinant or genetic
      IL13Ralpha2, but not mock-immunized controls, demonstrated complete protection
      against IL13Ralpha2( + ) glioma growth and mortality. Of interest, only the
      recombinant-protein-based vaccines generated detectable anti-IL13Ralpha2
      antibodies. These studies demonstrate the in vivo efficiency of protein- and
      DNA-based immunotherapy strategies that target IL13Ralpha2 that may play a
      clinical role to eradicate the residual microscopic HGA cells that inevitably
      cause disease recurrence and mortality.

TI  - Distress persists in long-term brain tumor survivors with glioblastoma
      multiforme.
PG  - 269-74
LID - 10.1007/s11764-008-0069-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive
      type of primary brain tumor. The prognosis for GBM patients is extremely poor
      with an estimated median survival of 12 months. Despite this statistic, a number 
      of GBM patients are living longer than in the past as new detection and treatment
      approaches are used. However, little is known about the psychological correlates 
      of this disease. To address this issue we investigated distress and its sources
      in long-term survivors (LTS) of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants
      were asked to complete the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's (NCCN)
      Distress Thermometer, a single-item rapid screening tool for distress.
      Participants were also asked to designate sources of distress from a 34-item list
      developed by the NCCN. Distress scores and sources of distress for long-term GBM 
      survivors (>18 months) were compared to patients diagnosed within the last 18
      months (<18 months). RESULTS: Eight-three brain tumor patients participated in
      this study. Fifty-nine percent of LTS met the > or = 4 cut-off score for distress
      (M = 4.61, SD 3.12) as compared to 49% of patients diagnosed less than 18 months 
      (M = 3.93, SD = 2.21; x(2) = 0.406, NS), LTS reported fewer items of concern
      while more LTS reported being distressed. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that 
      LTS of GBM report experiencing distress at similar levels to other brain tumor
      patients. Level of distress for LTS is directly related to the total number of
      concerns in both emotional and physical domains. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER
      SURVIVORS: Regardless of LTS status, distress continues to be a part of the
      disease trajectory for many GBM patients. As such, attention to distress in these
      survivors of a major life threatening disease is warranted in follow up
      surveillance visits.

AB  - Depigmented or hypopigmented macules and patches have been described in
      association to primary and metastatic melanoma. Primary melanoma presenting at
      the onset as a vitiliginous patch without histopathological evidence of
      regression seems to be a rare event. We report 2 patients with melanoma in situ
      that expressed clinically as vitiligo-like patches and review the possible
      immunologic mechanisms responsible for this unusual presentation.

TI  - Soluble monomeric EphrinA1 is released from tumor cells and is a functional
      ligand for the EphA2 receptor.
PG  - 7260-73
LID - 10.1038/onc.2008.328 [doi]
AB  - The ephrinA1 ligand exerts antioncogenic effects in tumor cells through
      activation and downregulation of the EphA2 receptor and has been described as a
      membrane-anchored protein requiring clustering for function. However, while
      investigating the ephrinA1/EphA2 system in the pathobiology of glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM), we uncovered that ephrinA1 is released from GBM and breast
      adenocarcinoma cells as a soluble, monomeric protein and is a functional form of 
      the ligand in this state. Conditioned media containing a soluble monomer of
      ephrinA1 caused EphA2 internalization and downregulation, dramatic alteration of 
      cell morphology and suppression of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Moreover, soluble
      monomeric ephrinA1 was functional in a physiological context, eliciting collapse 
      of embryonic neuronal growth cones. We also found that ephrinA1 is cleaved from
      the plasma membrane of GBM cells, an event which involves the action of a
      metalloprotease. Thus, the ephrinA1 ligand can, indeed, function as a soluble
      monomer and may act in a paracrine manner on the EphA2 receptor without the need 
      for juxtacrine interactions. These findings have important implications for
      further deciphering the function of these proteins in pathology and physiology,
      as well as for the design of ephrinA1-based EphA2-targeted antitumor
      therapeutics.

PG  - 205-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1473-2165.2008.00390.x [doi]
AB  - Photography is critical to accurately capturing clinical results in cosmetic
      dermatology. However, this shift from film to digital photography has made the
      capture of true ultraviolet (UV) images more difficult. Film cameras were
      developed that used special lighting and film to create true UV images, but this 
      technology has not translated into the digital realm. At present, commercial
      digital photography systems use computer processing to generate UV-like images
      from visible light photography. This research developed a technique to obtain UV 
      images with a UV pass glass filter placed in front of the camera lens. The UV
      filter was opaque to visible light (400-750 nm) with a peak transmission at 360
      nm. In addition, a glass infrared (IR) block filter was also placed in front of
      the UV filter during photography. This research resulted in the development of an
      affordable digital camera system that was able to capture true UV light
      photographs. This technique can be used by research and clinical dermatologists
      to obtain photographs demonstrating changes in photodamage as a result of
      therapeutic intervention.

      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 164-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pigmentary disorders are commonly seen in dermatology practice and
      can have a negative psychosocial impact on patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims
      to examine the prevalence of pigmentary disorders and their level of
      psychological and physical impact on patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort
      study involved a sample of 140 patients undergoing skin exams at a private
      dermatology practice in North Carolina. Patient demographics and pigmentary
      diagnoses were obtained, and participants were asked to fill out a skin
      discoloration impact evaluation questionnaire. Descriptive and frequency analyses
      were performed. RESULTS: Around 80% of the participants were diagnosed with one
      or more pigmentary disorders. About 47.3% of patients admitted of feeling
      self-conscious about their skin to some degree, 21.8% felt others focused on
      their skin, 32.7% felt unattractive because of their skin, 32.7% put effort into 
      hiding pigment changes, and 23.6% felt their skin affected their activities. A
      limitation was the lack of diversity in the population studied (gender and skin
      type). CONCLUSIONS: Pigmentary disorders such as melasma, vitiligo, and lentigo
      pose significant negative impact on a person's health-related quality of life.
      Hence, there is a need for effective treatments of pigmentary disorders based on 
      their prevalence and effect on quality of life. Healthcare providers should
      consider the impact of pigmentary disorders on health-related quality of life and
      educate patients on possible treatments.

      candidate genes.
PG  - 439-51
LID - 10.1016/j.mcn.2008.07.027 [doi]
AB  - Six genes in the 1.5 Mb region of chromosome 22 deleted in DiGeorge/22q11
      deletion syndrome-Mrpl40, Prodh, Slc25a1, Txnrd2, T10, and Zdhhc8-encode
      mitochondrial proteins. All six genes are expressed in the brain, and maximal
      expression coincides with peak forebrain synaptogenesis shortly after birth.
      Furthermore, their protein products are associated with brain mitochondria,
      including those in synaptic terminals. Among the six, only Zddhc8 influences
      mitochondria-regulated apoptosis when overexpressed, and appears to interact
      biochemically with established mitochondrial proteins. Zdhhc8 has an apparent
      interaction with Uqcrc1, a component of mitochondrial complex III. The two
      proteins are coincidently expressed in pre-synaptic processes; however, Zdhhc8 is
      more frequently seen in glutamatergic terminals. 22q11 deletion may alter
      metabolic properties of cortical mitochondria during early post-natal life, since
      expression complex III components, including Uqcrc1, is significantly increased
      at birth in a mouse model of 22q11 deletion, and declines to normal values in
      adulthood. Our results suggest that altered dosage of one, or several 22q11
      mitochondrial genes, particularly during early post-natal cortical development,
      may disrupt neuronal metabolism or synaptic signaling.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is a consistent
      tumor-specific mutation that is widely expressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
      and other neoplasms. As such it represents a truly tumor-specific target for
      antitumor immunotherapy. Although endogenous humoral responses to EGFRvIII have
      been reported in patients with EGFRvIII-expressing breast cancer, it is not known
      whether de novo responses can be generated or endogenous responses enhanced with 
      an EGFRvIII-specific vaccine. To assess this in clinical trials, we have
      developed and validated an immunoassay to measure and isolate anti-EGFRvIII and
      anti-KLH antibodies from the serum of patients vaccinated with an
      EGFRvIII-specific peptide (PEPvIII) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin
      (KLH). Using magnetic beads with immobilized antigen we captured and detected
      anti-EGFRvIII and anti-KLH antibodies in serum from patients before and after
      vaccinations. Using this assay, we found that significant levels of antibody for 
      tumor-specific antigen EGFRvIII (>4 microg/mL) and KLH could be induced after
      vaccination with PEPvIII-KLH.

TI  - The Dandy-Walker variant: a case series of 24 pediatric patients and evaluation
      of associated anomalies, incidence of hydrocephalus, and developmental outcomes.
PG  - 194-9
LID - 10.3171/PED/2008/2/9/194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: The Dandy-Walker complex is a continuum of aberrant development of the
      posterior fossa that has been associated with multiple congenital anomalies,
      radiographic abnormalities, and developmental delay. The Dandy-Walker variant
      (DWV) is a unique entity believed to represent a milder form of the complex, and 
      is characterized by a specific constellation of radiographic findings. In this
      retrospective case series, the authors report the association of the DWV with
      other congenital anomalies, the associated radiographic findings linked with DWV,
      and the developmental outcome in this population. METHODS: The charts and
      radiographs of 10 male and 14 female patients treated between 2000 and 2006 were 
      examined. The patients' mean gestational age was 35.6 weeks (range 23-41 weeks), 
      and the mean follow-up period was 5.1 years (range 1 month-15 years). RESULTS:
      Three patients died. Associated anomalies included cardiac (41.7%), neurological 
      (33.3%), gastrointestinal (20.8%), orthopedic (12.5%), and genitourinary (12.5%) 
      abnormalities. Less common were pulmonary and psychiatric findings. Developmental
      delay was identified in 11 of the 21 patients for whom follow-up was available.
      Five of 6 patients with isolated DWV had a normal developmental course.
      Radiographic findings associated with DWV included corpus callosum dysgenesis in 
      20.8%, ventricular enlargement in 29%, and vermian rotation in 8.3%. Shunts were 
      placed in 4 of 7 patients with ventriculomegaly. Using the two-tailed Pearson
      correlation, the authors determined that developmental outcome was solely
      affected by neurological deficits and that ventricular enlargement predicted the 
      need for shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: The DWV was associated with both extra-
      and intracranial anomalies. Associated radiographic abnormalities including
      ventriculomegaly were observed. Hydrocephalus requiring cerebrospinal fluid
      diversion may be indicated. Isolated DWV was associated with a good developmental
      outcome.

TI  - Serum inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and matrix hyaluronan promote angiogenesis in
      fibrotic lung injury.
PG  - 939-47
LID - 10.1164/rccm.200803-386OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The etiology and pathogenesis of angiogenesis in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) is poorly understood. Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IaI) is a
      serum protein that can bind to hyaluronan (HA) and may contribute to the
      angiogenic response to tissue injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether IaI
      promotes HA-mediated angiogenesis in tissue injury. METHODS: An examination was
      undertaken of angiogenesis in IaI-sufficient and -deficient mice in the bleomycin
      model of pulmonary fibrosis and in angiogenesis assays in vivo and in vitro. IaI 
      and HA in patients with IPF were examined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: IaI
      significantly enhances the angiogenic response to short-fragment HA in vivo and
      in vitro. lal deficiency Ieads to decreased angiogenesis in the matrigel model,
      and decreases lung angiogenesis after bleomycin exposure in mice. IaI is found in
      fibroblastic foci in IPF, where it colocalizes with HA. The colocalization is
      particularly strong in vascular areas around fibroblastic foci. Serum levels of
      IaI and HA are significantly elevated in patients with IPF compared with control 
      subjects. High serum IaI and HA levels are associated with decreased lung
      diffusing capacity, but not FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that serum
      IaI interacts with HA, and promotes angiogenesis in lung injury. IaI appears to
      contribute to the vascular response to lung injury and may lead to aberrant
      angiogenesis. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov
      (NCT00016627).

TI  - PCB126 exposure disrupts zebrafish ventricular and branchial but not early neural
      crest development.
PG  - 193-205
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfn154 [doi]
AB  - We have used zebrafish and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) to
      investigate the developmental toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that
      exert their effects through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We found that
      cardiac and neural crest (NC)-derived jaw and branchial cartilages are
      specifically targeted early in development. The suite of malformations, which
      ultimately leads to circulatory failure, includes a severely dysmorphic heart
      with a reduced bulbus arteriosus and abnormal atrioventricular and outflow valve 
      formation. Early NC migration and patterning of the jaw and branchial cartilages 
      was normal. However, the jaw and branchial cartilages failed to grow to normal
      size. In the heart, the ventricular myocardium showed a reduction in cell number 
      and size. The heart and jaw/branchial phenotype could be rescued by
      pifithrin-alpha, a blocker of p53. However, the function of pifithrin-alpha in
      this model may act as a competitive inhibitor of PCB at the AHR and is likely
      independent of p53. Morpholinos against p53 did not rescue the phenotype, nor
      were zebrafish with a mutant p53-null allele resistant to PCB126 toxicity.
      Morpholino knockdown of cardiac troponin T, which blocks the onset of cardiac
      function, prevented the PCB126-induced cardiac dysmorphogenesis but not the
      jaw/branchial phenotype. The cardiovascular characteristics appear to be similar 
      to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and introduce the potential of
      zebrafish as a model to study this environmentally induced cardiovascular
      malformation. HLHS is a severe congenital cardiovascular malformation that has
      previously been linked to industrial releases of dioxins and PCBs.

TI  - Hydrocephalus as a possible additional contributor to cognitive outcome in
      survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma.
PG  - 1157-61
LID - 10.1002/pon.1349 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between
      shunted hydrocephalus and intellectual, memory and academic functioning in a
      group of survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma. METHODS: Data from measures of
      cognitive, memory, academic and visual-motor functioning were gathered
      retrospectively from 35 survivors. Of these survivors, 10 (28.6%) required
      ventriculoperitoneal-shunt placement for hydrocephalus posttumor resection.
      RESULTS: Results revealed that participants with shunted hydrocephalus
      demonstrated significantly lower IQs, lower nonverbal intellectual functioning,
      lower academic skills in writing and math, and impairments in visual-motor
      abilities when compared with those without shunt. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      highlight the need to explore other variables--in addition to radiation and
      chemotherapy--as risk factors for neurocognitive impairments in survivors.
      Furthermore, identification of physiological substrates underlying these deficits
      is needed.

TI  - Myocardial infarction in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a single-center
      experience and literature review.
PG  - 311-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01112.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several case reports and series have described myocardial infarctions
      (MIs) in patients hospitalized for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The
      exact magnitude and outcome of this complication are unknown. METHODS: Electronic
      medical records for patients admitted to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical
      Center were examined from 1996 to 2005. Those patients having a diagnosis of TTP 
      during the hospitalization period were included in the analysis. Only patients'
      initial episodes of TTP were analyzed. Baseline cardiac and TTP risk factors were
      documented. Outcomes analyzed included MIs, arrhythmias, development of
      congestive heart failure and death. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients diagnosed with 
      TTP were identified with 13 (15.3%) having MIs, as defined by an elevation of
      cardiac enzymes. Median troponin I value was 5.9 ng/mL (range 3.7-8.8 ng/mL).
      Twelve patients had non-ST segment elevation MIs and one had ST segment
      elevation. Two of 13 patients who had echocardiographic analysis had documented
      wall motion abnormalities. There was no difference between non-MI and MI patients
      in cardiac risk factors, prior cardiac events, history of thromboembolic disease 
      or heart failure. There was no in-hospital mortality difference. CONCLUSION: MI
      is an important complication of TTP, identified in 15.3% of patients in our
      study. Routine cardiovascular evaluation with cardiac enzymes,
      electrocardiography, and telemetry is warranted in acute TTP patients.
      Appropriate intervention is yet to be determined.

TI  - Treatment of Citrobacter koseri infection with ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime in a 
      preterm infant.
PG  - 1134-8
LID - 10.1345/aph.1L008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of successful treatment of Citrobacter koseri
      infection in a preterm infant as a means of challenging the current treatment
      recommendations on the basis of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      considerations. CASE SUMMARY: A premature infant was diagnosed with C. koseri
      sepsis after 3 weeks in intensive care. Concern for meningitis was based on the
      propensity for central nervous system (CNS) involvement with Citrobacter
      infection along with new findings of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus shown on 
      cranial ultrasound (CUS). The infant was treated with ciprofloxacin 10-20 mg/day 
      and cefotaxime 100 mg/day for 21 days. After treatment, lumbar puncture was
      normal, follow-up CUS returned to baseline, and the infant passed a hearing
      screen after discharge. A favorable outcome was achieved in this case.
      DISCUSSION: Approximately 76% of neonatal patients infected with C. koseri
      develop brain abscesses. The mortality rate for meningitis due to Citrobacter
      spp. is approximately 30%, and of the infants who survive, more than 80% have
      some degree of mental retardation. Third-generation cephalosporins and
      aminoglycosides are traditional therapies against this infection. The current
      antibiotic strategies have failed to prevent the high rates of morbidity and
      mortality associated with Citrobacter infections. A possible basis for these poor
      outcomes is failure to apply appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      principles in selecting antibiotics that will achieve adequate concentrations to 
      kill the bacteria in granulocytes within the CNS. Based on favorable sensitivity 
      data, penetration into neutrophils and the CNS, and favorable toxicity profiles, 
      ciprofloxacin and meropenem would appear to be the most appropriate antibiotic
      treatment options for systemic infection or meningitis caused by C. koseri.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin and meropenem should be considered antibiotic
      treatment options for systemic infection or meningitis caused by C. koseri.

TI  - Factors affecting success of thymus transplantation for complete DiGeorge
      anomaly.
PG  - 1729-36
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02301.x [doi]
AB  - Thymus transplantation shows promise for the treatment of athymia in complete
      DiGeorge anomaly. This report reviews the effects of dose of thymus tissue, ABO
      compatibility, HLA matching, culture conditions, age of donor and
      immunosuppression of recipient on immune outcomes at 1 year after
      transplantation. Forty-nine athymic subjects have been treated with cultured
      postnatal allogeneic thymus tissue; 36 (73%) survive with only one subject on
      immunosuppression at 1.5 years. Of 31 surviving subjects more than 1 year after
      transplantation, 30 (97%) developed naive T cells, T-cell proliferative responses
      to mitogens and a diverse T-cell receptor beta variable (TCRBV) repertoire. The
      dose of thymus tissue, HLA matching and use of immunosuppression had
      nonsignificant effects on these outcome variables. Removal of deoxyguanosine from
      culture medium and length of culture did not adversely affect outcomes. Use of
      thymus tissue from donors over 1 month of age, versus under 1 month, resulted in 
      higher total T-cell numbers (p = 0.03). However, this finding must be confirmed
      in a prospective trial. Although subtle immune effects may yet be associated with
      some of the factors tested, it is remarkable that consistently good immune
      outcomes result despite variation in dose, HLA matching and use of
      immunosuppression.

PG  - 2678-83
LID - 10.1007/s00330-008-1044-4 [doi]
AB  - The utility of measuring the corpus callosal angle (CA) for the diagnosis of
      idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) was investigated.
      Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 34 INPH
      patients, 34 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and 34 normal control (NC)
      subjects. Measurement of the CA on the coronal MR images of the posterior
      commissure perpendicular to the anteroposterior commissure plane was performed
      for all subjects. The CA of the INPH group (mean +/- SD, 66 +/- 14 degrees) was
      significantly smaller than those of the AD (104 +/- 15 degrees) and NC (112 +/-
      11 degrees) groups. When using the threshold of the mean - 2SD value of the NC
      group (= 90 degrees), an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of 97%, and specificity of 
      88% were observed for discrimination of INPH from AD patients. Measuring the CA
      helps in differentiating INPH patients from AD and normally aged subjects.

TI  - Use of allograft biopsies to assess thymopoiesis after thymus transplantation.
PG  - 6354-64
AB  - Thymus allograft biopsies were performed in athymic infants with complete
      DiGeorge anomaly after thymus transplantation to assess whether the thymus
      allograft tissue was able to support thymopoiesis. Forty-four consecutive infants
      were treated with postnatal cultured thymus allografts. Thirty biopsies and six
      autopsies evaluating the allograft site were obtained in 33 infants, 23 of whom
      survive. The allograft was examined by immunohistochemistry for evidence of
      thymopoiesis. Grafted thymus tissue was found in 25 of 30 biopsies, 23 of which
      showed thymopoiesis. All 19 survivors with thymopoiesis on biopsy developed naive
      T cells and T cell function. Autopsies were done in six subjects, three of whom
      had biopsies. All autopsy samples contained thymus tissue including one for which
      the biopsy had not contained graft. Of the six autopsies, one had evidence of
      thymopoiesis. Epithelium without thymopoiesis was seen in two of 25 biopsies in
      which thymus tissue was detected and in five of six autopsies. Graft rejection
      was seen in one autopsy. Biopsies were important for showing the following: 1)
      the damaging effect of pulse steroids on thymopoiesis; 2) the need for adequate
      immunosuppression of atypical subjects; and 3) the presence of thymopoiesis in
      the presence of ongoing immunosuppression. In addition, the biopsy could rule out
      graft rejection in the atypical subjects who had oligoclonal T cells that could
      cause rejection. In summary, combining biopsy and autopsy data, allogeneic thymus
      tissues showed thymopoiesis in 24 of 29 (86%) evaluable transplants. The results 
      of these biopsies led to improved care of these complex patients.

TI  - Cryptococcal meningitis in patients with glioma: a report of two cases.
PG  - 51-3
LID - 10.1007/s11060-008-9581-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We describe two patients with high-grade glioma
      undergoing treatment with corticosteroids and chemotherapy who presented with
      cryptococcal meningitis and sepsis. This report of two cases highlights the
      importance of examining the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic and/or antifungal
      regimens in this patient population due to their increased risk of opportunistic 
      infections. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man with a history of
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), on dexamethasone and status post radiation therapy
      and two cycles of temozolamide, presented with decreased level of consciousness
      for 24 h and was found to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures
      positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. A 33-year-old man with a history of
      anaplastic astrocytoma, on dexamethasone and status post radiation therapy, four 
      cycles of temozolomide and two cycles of Lomustine (CCNU), presented with
      headache, dizziness and photophobia and was found to have CSF and blood cultures 
      positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. INTERVENTION: Both patients were treated
      with an initial regimen of amphotericin B and flucytosine for a minimum of two
      weeks and switched to fluconazole for 6 months to 1 year of treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with high-grade glioma treated with long-term corticosteroid
      therapy and chemotherapy are at increased risk of developing opportunistic
      infections. The two patients reported here developed cryptococcal meningitis and 
      sepsis. Prophylactic regimens with either fluconazole or itraconazole currently
      exist that effectively decrease the incidence of both cryptococcal infections.
      Further investigations into the risk:benefit ratio of primary prophylactic
      therapy in this patient population may prove beneficial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess social functioning and facial expression recognition skill
      in survivors of pediatric brain tumors (BT) as compared to children with juvenile
      rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). METHODS: The social functioning of 51 survivors of BT
      and 31 children with JRA was assessed using a facial expression recognition task,
      questionnaire ratings of social functioning, and an IQ screener. RESULTS: After
      controlling for estimated IQ, survivors of BT made significantly more errors
      interpreting adult facial expressions as compared to children with JRA.
      Additionally, history of therapy and diagnosis age predicted performance on the
      child portion of the facial recognition task. Finally, survivors of BT
      demonstrated significantly impaired social functioning across multiple measures
      when compared to children with JRA. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of pediatric BT showed
      significant deficits in social functioning as compared to an illness comparison
      group. Errors in facial expression recognition represent another method for
      evaluating deficits that contribute to social outcomes.

PG  - 129-32

AB  - 9-year-old castrated male Greyhound dog was presented for evaluation of vomiting 
      and lethargy of 1-week duration. On physical examination, the dog was febrile and
      dehydrated with a tense abdomen and petechial hemorrhages. Clinicopathologic
      abnormalities included relative polycythemia, mild lymphopenia with reactive
      lymphocytes, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased 
      ALP, mild hypokalemia, hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia, increased D-dimer
      concentration, and hyperfibrinogenemia. Cytologic evaluation of peritoneal fluid 
      revealed marked suppurative inflammation with intracellular barium sulfate
      particles. The day before presentation, the referring veterinarian had
      administered oral barium sulfate in an upper gastrointestinal contrast study.
      Radiographs revealed free contrast material in the peritoneal cavity, consistent 
      with gastrointestinal perforation, and leakage of contrast material. Abdominal
      exploratory surgery revealed a mid-jejunal perforation and a hepatic nodule.
      Histopathologic diagnosis of the jejunal and liver lesions was T-cell lymphoma.
      The patient recovered well postoperatively and received chemotherapy for
      treatment of lymphoma. Most commercial barium sulfate preparations contain
      relatively uniform, weakly birefringent, pale yellow particles <1 microm in
      diameter. Because barium sulfate is found occasionally in clinical specimens,
      cytopathologists should be familiar with its cytologic appearance.

AB  - A bilingual pediatric patient who underwent tumor resection was mapped
      extraoperatively using cortical stimulation to preserve English and Hebrew
      languages. The authors mapped both languages by using 4 tasks: 1) English visual 
      naming, 2) Hebrew visual naming, 3) read English/respond Hebrew, and 4) Hebrew
      reading. Essential cortical sites for primary and secondary languages were
      compared, photographically recorded, and plotted onto a schematic brain of the
      patient. Three types of sites were found in this patient: 1) multiuse sites
      (multiple tasks, both languages) in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas; 2)
      single-task sites (1 task, both languages) in postcentral and parietal areas; and
      3) single-use sites (1 task, 1 language) in frontal, temporal, and parietal
      areas. These results lend support to the concept that bilingual patients can have
      distinct cortical representations of each language and of different language
      tasks, in addition to overlapping or shared sites that support both languages and
      multiple tasks.

TI  - Neurosurgical implications of osteogenesis imperfecta in children. Report of 4
      cases.
PG  - 229-36
LID - 10.3171/PED/2008/1/3/229 [doi]
AB  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
      disruption of normal collagen formation resulting in varying degrees of skeletal 
      vulnerability, ligamentous laxity, and scleral discoloration. Children with OI
      may suffer from complex neurosurgical problems affecting the brain and spine. The
      authors sought to determine the neurosurgical implications of OI in a cohort of
      patients treated at a quaternary care center for pediatrics. The authors reviewed
      the case histories of 10 children with OI treated by the neurosurgical service at
      the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto between January 1988 and March 2007.
      The cases of 4 of these children are highlighted in the article. The most common 
      neurosurgical conditions encountered in this cohort included macrocephaly in 5
      patients, subdural hematoma in 3 patients, epidural hematoma in 2 patients, and
      hydrocephalus in 3 patients. Basilar invagination and spinal fractures were
      observed in 20% of the cohort. Although some patients could be treated
      nonoperatively, several required craniotomy for clot evacuation, decompression,
      and spinal fixation for fracture or basilar invagination, and cerebrospinal fluid
      shunt insertion. Neurosurgical conditions affecting patients with OI include
      macrocephaly, the development of an acute intracranial hematoma after often
      minimal trauma, the development of chronic subdural fluid collections that may
      require drainage, hydrocephalus (both communicating and noncommunicating),
      basilar invagination, and subaxial spinal fractures. Surgery may be complicated
      in some children because of the underlying bone fragility and bleeding diathesis 
      commonly observed in patients with OI.

TI  - The cutaneous manifestations of atypical complete DiGeorge syndrome: a
      histopathologic and immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 380-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2007.00816.x [doi]
AB  - DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings that
      includes thymic hypoplasia. Only a small subset of patients with DiGeorge
      syndrome has complete athymia, classified as complete DiGeorge anomaly; one third
      of these patients show an eczematous dermatitis, oligoclonal T-cells and
      lymphadenopathy, known as atypical complete DiGeorge anomaly. Six biopsies from
      six patients with the distinctive clinical phenotype of atypical complete
      DiGeorge anomaly were studied. Every biopsy showed exocytosis (100%),
      parakeratosis, often confluent and spongiosis (100%). Neutrophilic abscesses
      (50%), dyskeratosis (67%) and satellite cell necrosis (50%) were seen.
      Perieccrine and perivascular inflammation were seen in half of the cases.
      Eosinophils were identified (83%); most commonly in both the epidermis and
      dermis. All of lymphocytes were CD3 positive. Most (83%) of cases contained
      T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1) positive cells. Special testing of the
      selected patients using spectratyping identified oligoclonal T-cell populations. 
      The presence of dyskeratotic keratinocytes, satellite cell necrosis and
      parakeratotic scale with neutrophils characterizes the cutaneous rash seen in
      this subset of complete DiGeorge syndrome patients. Such skin lesions from
      patients with DiGeorge anomaly should alert the pathologist to the potential
      diagnosis of atypical complete DiGeorge anomaly. The pathophysiologic role of the
      oligoclonal T-cells in this entity requires additional study.

TI  - [L-dopa sensitive Parkinsonism in neurocysticercosis].
PG  - 119-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neurocysticercosis (NC) is a chronic parasitary disease that may
      have different neurological manifestations, such as seizures, dementia or
      obstructive hydrocephalus. On rare occasions, pictures secondary to hydrocephalia
      may occur with Parkinsonian syndrome. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a
      29-year old woman with serologically confirmed NC and obstructive hydrocephalia
      secondary to a cyst in the IV ventricle. The patient required repeated
      ventricle-peritoneal shunt replacement because of valvular malfunction and
      obstructive hydrocephalia. She developed Parkinsonian's syndrome, which subsided 
      after combined treatment with cysticidal drugs and L-dopa. DISCUSSION:
      Parkinsonian syndrome is an atypical presentation in NC. In this case, the
      above-mentioned profile is found within the context of multiple valvular
      malfunctions who nature is reversible after appropriate treatment. It seems to be
      related with increases in intraventricular cerebrospinal fluid pressure. We can
      conclude that Parkinsonian syndromes may be one more expression of NC. This
      acquires greater importance according to its context, in addition to the limited 
      presence of similar cases in our environment in the literature.

TI  - A pilot study: 131I-antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81c6 to deliver a 44-Gy
      resection cavity boost.

LID - 10.1215/15228517-2007-053 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and assess the
      efficacy and toxicity, among newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients, of
      administering (131)I-labeled murine antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6
      ((131)I-81C6) into a surgically created resection cavity (SCRC) to achieve a
      patient-specific, 44-Gy boost to the 2-cm SCRC margin. A radioactivity dose of
      (131)I-81C6 calculated to achieve a 44-Gy boost to the SCRC was administered,
      followed by conventional external beam radiotherapy (XRT) and chemotherapy.
      Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study: 16 with glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM) and 5 with anaplastic astrocytoma. Twenty patients received the targeted
      44-Gy boost (+/-10%) to the SCRC. Attributable toxicity was mild and limited to
      reversible grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (n = 3; 14%), CNS wound
      infections (n = 3; 14%), and headache (n = 2; 10%). With a median follow-up of
      151 weeks, median overall survival times for all patients and those with GBM are 
      96.6 and 90.6 weeks, respectively; 87% of GBM patients are alive at 1 year. It is
      feasible to consistently achieve a 44-Gy boost dose to the SCRC margin with
      patient-specific dosing of (131)I-81C6. Our study regimen ((131)I-81C6 + XRT +
      temozolomide) was well tolerated and had encouraging survival. To determine if
      selection of good-prognosis patients affects outcome associated with this
      approach, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial randomizing 
      newly diagnosed GBM patients to either our study regimen or standard XRT plus
      temozolomide.

TI  - Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor in high-grade astrocytomas.
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1007/s11864-008-0053-5 [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: High-grade astrocytomas, including glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), are the most common and aggressive primary
      malignant brain tumors in adults. Despite improvements in survival with the
      addition of temozolomide to radiation in the adjuvant setting, the prognosis of
      patients affected by these tumors remains relatively poor. One approach to
      improve outcomes in these patients is to target the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR). EGFR-targeted therapy is a rational approach since EGFR
      overexpression and mutant EGFRvIII expression occur in approximately 50% of
      patients with GBM. Unfortunately, monotherapy with anti-EGFR agents in malignant 
      gliomas has not provided the dramatic results sometimes seen with other targeted 
      therapies, such as imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Anti-EGFR agents
      currently being studied in malignant gliomas include the tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI), monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and anti-EGFR vaccines. Of all
      these agents, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors-which include erlotinib and
      gefitinib-have been the most extensively tested in clinical trials. Retrospective
      analyses have highlighted co-expression of EGFRvIII and wild-type PTEN
      (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) as a significant
      predictor of EGFR TKI response in patients with GBM. As the EGFR signaling
      pathway is exceptionally complex, newer approaches targeting multiple points in
      the pathway are being developed to improve treatment efficacy.

TI  - Utility of EGFR and PTEN numerical aberrations in the evaluation of diffusely
      infiltrating astrocytomas. Laboratory investigation.
PG  - 330-5
LID - 10.3171/JNS/2008/108/2/0330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas are the most common primary brain
      tumors. As a group, they demonstrate an inherent tendency toward malignant
      progression. Histological grading using the guidelines of the World Health
      Organization (WHO) remains the gold standard for predicting the biological
      behavior of these tumors. Although useful, this grading system is often limited
      due to small sample sizes and the subjectivity in interpretation. Given the
      important roles for EGFR and PTEN in the malignant progression of astrocytomas,
      the authors hypothesized that the fraction of tumor cells with aberrations in
      these genetic loci would correlate with the histological grade. METHODS: The
      authors evaluated 217 consecutive diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas that were
      graded using the WHO guidelines, including 16 diffuse astrocytomas (WHO Grade
      II), 72 anaplastic astrocytomas ([AAs] WHO Grade III), and 129 glioblastomas
      multiforme ([GBMs] WHO Grade IV). Cases were evaluated quantitatively using
      dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for the EGFR and PTEN
      loci and the centromeres of chromosomes 7 and 10. RESULTS: The population of
      tumor cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 and the EGFR locus and monosomy of
      chromosome 10 and the PTEN locus correlated significantly with histological
      grade. In particular, high-grade astrocytomas (that is, AAs and GBMs) had
      elevated fractions of tumor cells with polysomy of chromosome 7 and the EGFR
      locus and monosomy of chromosome 10 and the PTEN locus. Using these findings, the
      authors generated a mathematical model capable of subcategorizing high-grade
      astrocytomas. The successful model incorporated only the percentage of tumor
      cells with polysomy of EGFR and monosomy of PTEN, as well as patient age. The
      predictions of this model correlated with survival in a manner similar to
      histopathological grading. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented in this study
      emphasize the utility of combining histological interpretation and molecular
      testing in the evaluation of infiltrating astrocytomas. These results underscore 
      the utility of building a grading framework that combines histopathological and
      molecular analysis.

PG  - 235-9
LID - 10.1093/bja/aem375 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare condition associated with
      diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and pulmonary fibrosis. We describe the anaesthetic 
      management of a parturient with a history of posterior spinal fusion presenting
      with an acute exacerbation of IPH necessitating vaginal delivery at 34 weeks
      gestation. We used a spinal catheter for labour analgesia and bilevel positive
      airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation to improve oxygenation during labour. An
      arterial line sited to allow frequent arterial blood gas sampling also
      facilitated continuous cardiac output monitoring. The use of a carefully titrated
      neuraxial block for analgesia, in conjunction with BIPAP, was associated with
      minimal haemodynamic and respiratory compromise during labour in this patient.

TI  - Thrombin-promoted release of UDP-glucose from human astrocytoma cells.
PG  - 1528-37
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The P2Y14 receptor is activated by UDP-sugars, most
      potently by UDP-glucose, but not by free nucleotides, suggesting that UDP-glucose
      is the cognate agonist for this receptor. However, evidence for regulated release
      of UDP-glucose is scarce. In the present study, the occurrence of
      receptor-promoted release of UDP-glucose was investigated, using 1321N1 human
      astrocytoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: UDP-glucose release and hydrolysis were
      measured using HPLC-based techniques. Phospholipase C activation and actin
      cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed by measuring inositol phosphate
      formation and fluorescence confocal microscopy, respectively. KEY RESULTS:
      Thrombin and the protease-activating receptor-1 (PAR1) peptide TFLLRNPNDK
      (PAR1-AP) evoked the release of UDP-glucose and ATP, which was accompanied by
      enhanced inositol phosphate formation. Although carbachol promoted fourfold
      greater inositol phosphate formation than thrombin, it failed to promote
      nucleotide release. Thrombin-promoted nucleotide release was inhibited by
      BAPTA-AM, brefeldin A and cytochalasin D, and was insensitive to Pertussis toxin 
      and PI3-kinase inhibitors. Thrombin, but not carbachol, induced actin
      cytoskeleton reorganization, a hallmark of Rho activation in 1321N1 cells.
      However, PAR-promoted UDP-glucose release was not affected by Rho kinase
      inhibition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PAR1-evoked UDP-glucose release
      reflected a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, engaging additional signalling
      independently of G(i) and Rho kinase activation and requiring a functional actin 
      cytoskeleton and Golgi structures. Our study demonstrates the occurrence of Ca2+ 
      -dependent release of UDP-glucose from astrocytoma cells in response to a
      physiologically relevant stimulus, that is, a G-protein-coupled receptor agonist.
      Given the presence of P2Y14 receptors in astrocytes, UDP-glucose may have
      important autocrine/paracrine functions in the brain.

TI  - Interstrand crosslink repair: can XPF-ERCC1 be let off the hook?
PG  - 70-6
LID - 10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.003 [doi]
AB  - The interstrand crosslink (ICL) presents a challenge to both the cell and the
      scientist. From a clinical standpoint, these lesions are particularly intriguing:
      ICL-inducing agents are powerful tools in cancer chemotherapy, and spontaneous
      ICLs have recently been linked with accelerated aging phenotypes. Nevertheless,
      the ICL repair process has proven difficult to elucidate. Here we discuss recent 
      additions to the current model and argue that the endonuclease xeroderma
      pigmentosum complementation group F-excision repair cross-complementing rodent
      repair deficiency complementation group 1 (XPF-ERCC1) has been heretofore
      misplaced. During nucleotide excision repair, XPF-ERCC1 makes a single-strand
      nick adjacent to the lesion. XPF-ERCC1 has been thought to play an analogous role
      in ICL repair. However, recent data has implicated XPF-ERCC1 in homologous
      recombination. We suggest that this role, rather than its function in nucleotide 
      excision repair, defines its importance to ICL repair.

      in malignant astrocytoma patients treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.
PG  - 271-8
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.3652 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The combination of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      -neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab, and irinotecan is associated with high
      radiographic response rates and improved survival outcomes in patients with
      recurrent malignant gliomas. The aim of these retrospective studies was to
      evaluate tumor vascularity and expression of components of the VEGF pathway and
      hypoxic responses as predictive markers for radiographic response and survival
      benefit from the bevacizumab and irinotecan therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a
      phase II trial, 60 patients with recurrent malignant astrocytomas were treated
      with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Tumor specimens collected at the time of
      diagnosis were available for further pathologic studies in 45 patients (75%).
      VEGF, VEGF receptor-2, CD31, hypoxia-inducible carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), and
      hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha were semiquantitatively assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. Radiographic response and survival outcomes were correlated
      with these angiogenic and hypoxic markers. RESULTS: Of 45 patients, 27 patients
      had glioblastoma multiforme, and 18 patients had anaplastic astrocytoma.
      Twenty-six patients (58%) had at least partial radiographic response. High VEGF
      expression was associated with increased likelihood of radiographic response (P =
      .024) but not survival benefit. Survival analysis revealed that high CA9
      expression was associated with poor survival outcome (P = .016). CONCLUSION: In
      this patient cohort, tumor expression levels of VEGF, the molecular target of
      bevacizumab, were associated with radiographic response, and the upstream
      promoter of angiogenesis, hypoxia, determined survival outcome, as measured from 
      treatment initiation. Validation in a larger clinical trial is warranted.

TI  - Long-term tolerance to allogeneic thymus transplants in complete DiGeorge
      anomaly.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - Thymus transplantation in subjects with complete DiGeorge anomaly using postnatal
      allogeneic HLA-nonmatched cultured thymus tissue provides immunoreconstitution.
      Tolerance of the newly developed T cells toward the donor thymus has not
      previously been studied. Mixed lymphocyte cultures were used to test 12 thymus
      transplant recipients for long-term tolerance toward their thymus allografts. Two
      subjects tested for responses toward thymus donor peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells showed significantly less reactivity toward the donors compared to
      responses against third-party allogeneic cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells from 10 other subjects were less responsive toward cryopreserved donor
      thymic cells than toward allogeneic cells (P=0.00007). Adult control peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells proliferated strongly in response to the donor thymic
      cells. Both the subjects and controls showed similar proliferative responses
      against allogeneic cells and phytohemagglutinin. This study provides in vitro
      evidence for long-term tolerance of complete DiGeorge anomaly thymus
      transplantation recipients toward their HLA-nonmatched thymus grafts.

TI  - Differential Apaf-1 levels allow cytochrome c to induce apoptosis in brain tumors
      but not in normal neural tissues.
PG  - 20820-5
AB  - Brain tumors are typically resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics, most of
      which initiate apoptosis upstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. In this 
      study, we demonstrate that directly activating apoptosis downstream of the
      mitochondria, with cytosolic cytochrome c, kills brain tumor cells but not normal
      brain tissue. Specifically, cytosolic cytochrome c is sufficient to induce
      apoptosis in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cell lines. In contrast, primary
      neurons from the cerebellum and cortex are remarkably resistant to cytosolic
      cytochrome c. Importantly, tumor tissue from mouse models of both high-grade
      astrocytoma and medulloblastoma display hypersensitivity to cytochrome c when
      compared with surrounding brain tissue. This differential sensitivity to
      cytochrome c is attributed to high Apaf-1 levels in the tumor tissue compared
      with low Apaf-1 levels in the adjacent brain tissue. These differences in Apaf-1 
      abundance correlate with differences in the levels of E2F1, a previously
      identified activator of Apaf-1 transcription. ChIP assays reveal that E2F1 binds 
      the Apaf-1 promoter specifically in tumor tissue, suggesting that E2F1
      contributes to the expression of Apaf-1 in brain tumors. Together, these results 
      demonstrate an unexpected sensitivity of brain tumors to postmitochondrial
      induction of apoptosis. Moreover, they raise the possibility that this phenomenon
      could be exploited therapeutically to selectively kill brain cancer cells while
      sparing the surrounding brain parenchyma.

TI  - Distribution of pathologic findings in individuals with nephrotic proteinuria
      according to serum albumin.
PG  - 1595-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies of the nephrotic syndrome have not carefully
      examined the relationship between serum albumin and the distribution of
      pathologic diagnoses found at the time of biopsy. The spectrum of pathologic
      findings in individuals with nephrotic proteinuria and a normal serum albumin has
      not been determined. Knowledge regarding the spectrum of findings in nephrotic
      proteinuria according to serum albumin levels may help nephrologists in the
      clinical decision making of when to perform a renal biopsy and in determining
      proper management of these patients. METHODS: Pathologic reports of native kidney
      biopsies performed for idiopathic proteinuria >3 g/24 h were reviewed. Clinical
      characteristics and biopsy findings were compared for individuals with serum
      albumin <30 g/L (Group I), 30 to <35 g/L (Group II) and >/=35 g/L (Group III).
      RESULTS: There were 57 patients in Group I, 20 in Group II and 35 in Group III.
      The proportion of individuals with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 
      increased according to group: 26% in Group I, 45% in Group II and 74% in Group
      III. Of 35 patients in Group III, 34 had FSGS or advanced nephrosclerosis from
      another cause. Seven of 17 Group III patients with follow-up required dialysis
      after a mean interval of 6 years. Few of these patients received
      immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As serum albumin increases in the
      nephrotic syndrome, the proportion of patients with FSGS increases. Patients with
      nephrotic proteinuria and a serum albumin >35 g/L suffer from FSGS,
      nephrosclerosis and have poor renal survival. When evaluating nephrotic patients,
      nephrologists should use this knowledge about the spectrum of disease in the
      clinical decision making of when to perform a biopsy and in providing the patient
      more precise information regarding risks, benefits and alternatives of the kidney
      biopsy procedure.

TI  - Concept and treatment of hydrocephalus in the Greco-Roman and early Arabic
      medicine.
PG  - 253-64
AB  - In the ancient medical literature hydrocephalus was not often described although 
      its existence and symptomatology were well known. Most detailed descriptions of
      hydrocephalus including the surgical treatment are extant in the encyclopaedic
      works on medicine of the physicians Oreibasios and Aetios from Amida from the 4th
      and 6th centuries AD, respectively. Because of their broad scientific interests, 
      this type of physicians, typical for the late Roman empire, were known as
      philosophy-physicians (iota alpha tau rho o sigma o phi iota sigma tau alpha
      iota). They defined hydrocephalus in contrast to our present understanding as a
      fluid collection excluding abscesses visible as a bulging tumour localised either
      outside or inside the skull of an infant. They classified the hydrocephalus
      similar as stated first by Galen in the 2nd century AD in four types
      corresponding to the assumed anatomic localisation of the fluid collection: 1st
      Type between the skin and the pericranium corresponding to the subgaleal
      haematoma or caput succedaneum of the newborn in our terminology, 2nd Type
      between the pericranium and the skull corresponding to the cephal haematoma after
      delivery, 3rd Type between skull and the meninges with increased head
      circumference, bone sutures being increasingly driven apart corresponding most
      likely to the hydrocephalus in our understanding, and 4th Type between the
      menings and the brain characterised by severe neurological deficit with lethal
      prognosis corresponding probably to all pathologies which were accompanied by an 
      excessive increase of the intracranial pressure with a bulging fontanel. Due to
      the lack of autopsies in ancient times, the hydrocephalus was never linked to the
      pathology of the ventricles. All forms of hydrocephalus were believed to be
      caused by improper handling of the head by the midwife during delivery. Only the 
      extracranial fluid collections, but not hydrocephalus in our sense, were
      considered to be suitable for surgical treatment. The surgery consisted in one or
      more incisions and evacuation of the fluid. The wound was not closed but let open
      for three days. Thereafter plasters or sutures closed the incisions. The surgical
      technique goes back probably to Antyllos a surgeon from the 3rd century AD whose 
      considerations were cited in the work of Oreibasios. The early Arabic physicians 
      took over the surgical indications, the operative technique and modified the
      Greek concept of hydrocephalus. Avicenna separated the traumatic haematomas
      outside the skull from the term hydrocephalus. However Avicenna, as all previous 
      authors, had not linked hydrocephalus with the ventricular system. The autopsy of
      a child with an exorbitant hydrocephalus performed by the anatomist Vesalius in
      the 16th century revealed as a single pathology an extremely dilative ventricular
      system filled with water-like fluid which made it necessary to change completely 
      the ancient concept of hydrocephalus.

AB  - The availability of high-throughput genotyping and large collaborative clinical
      networks creating well-characterized patient populations with DNA repositories
      has facilitated genome-wide scans and candidate gene studies to identify
      susceptibility alleles for the development of interstitial lung disease. The
      association of pulmonary fibrosis with rare inherited disorders, and the variable
      susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to this disease indicate that pulmonary
      fibrosis is determined by genetic factors. Sarcoidosis represents a complex
      disease with racial and ethnic differences in disease prevalence, and evidence of
      familial clustering. Familial aggregation of sarcoidosis from 'A Case-Control
      Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis' (ACCESS) reveals a familial odds ratio (OR) of
      sarcoidosis of 5.8 (95% CI 2.1-15.9) for sibs and 3.8 (95% CI 1.2-11.3) for
      parents. Several HLA class II alleles have been associated with either increased 
      or decreased risk of sarcoidosis, and results vary depending on study populations
      of different ethnicity. Genome-wide screening has conclusively identified linkage
      to chromosome 5q11and the development of sarcoidosis, and HLA genes and BTNL2 are
      susceptibility genes located in this region. Familial aggregation of idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonia (IIP) has been established by several groups, and a large 
      US-based study suggests autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance;
      furthermore, cigarette smoking was associated with affection status among
      siblings (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.3-9.8, p = 0.01). Families demonstrate more than one
      type of IIP, suggesting various subtypes of IIP may share a common pathogenesis. 
      Genome-wide linkage scans in familial interstitial pneumonia demonstrate linkage 
      to chromosomes 4, 5 and 11. Candidate gene studies indicate that surfactant
      protein C and telomerase are susceptibility genes for the development of
      pulmonary fibrosis. Future challenges include determining how multiple
      susceptibility alleles interact with each other and environmental factors
      resulting in disease risk and multiple phenotypes, and determining the mechanism 
      of action and cellular pathways involving susceptibility alleles. Further insight
      into these areas may lead to new therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of high-grade astrocytoma.
PG  - 1111-39, x
AB  - High-grade astrocytomas include the most common adult central nervous system
      (CNS) tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, and anaplastic astrocytoma--a highly
      aggressive cancer with short median survival despite maximal multimodality
      therapy. Diagnosis is by clinical and radiographic findings confirmed by
      histopathology. Standard-of-care therapy includes surgical resection,
      radiotherapy, and temozolomide. Nearly all patients who have high-grade
      astrocytomas develop tumor recurrence or progression after this multimodality
      treatment. Two treatment challenges are molecular/genetic heterogeneity of tumors
      and limited CNS tumor delivery. It is probable that targeted therapies will be
      most effective in combination with one another or with cytotoxic therapies. This 
      article discusses diagnosis and current treatment of high-grade astrocytomas.

TI  - Advances in radiation therapy for brain tumors.
PG  - 1005-33, ix
AB  - Radiation therapy is used postoperatively as adjunctive therapy to decrease local
      failure; to delay tumor progression and prolong survival; as a curative
      treatment; as a therapy that halts further tumor growth; to alter function; and
      for palliation. Registration of MRI scan data sets with the treatment-planning CT
      scan is essential for accurate definition of the tumor and surrounding organs at 
      risk. Integrating additional imaging studies that reflect the biologic
      characteristics of central nervous system tumors is an area of active research.
      Conformal treatment delivery is used to spare adjacent normal tissue from
      receiving unnecessary dose. In the dose range used when treating these tumors,
      the probability of causing serious late toxicity is relatively low and secondary 
      malignancies are rare.

TI  - Sensitive detection of human cytomegalovirus in tumors and peripheral blood of
      patients diagnosed with glioblastoma.
PG  - 10-8
AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been described to be associated with several
      human malignancies, though the frequency of detection remains controversial. It
      is unclear whether HCMV plays an active role in malignant tumor progression or
      becomes reactivated under pathologic conditions that result in chronic
      inflammation or immunosuppression. In this study, we report on the investigation 
      of detecting HCMV in the tumors and peripheral blood of patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using immunohistochemistry, in situ
      hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral DNA, the
      detection of HCMV was investigated in tumor and blood specimens from patients
      with GBM as well as in the peripheral blood of normal volunteers and patients
      undergoing craniotomy for diagnoses other than GBM. We found that a high
      percentage (>90%) of GBM tumors, not surrounding normal brain, are associated
      with HCMV nucleic acids and proteins. Furthermore, a significant proportion of
      patients (80%) with newly diagnosed GBM have detectable HCMV DNA in their
      peripheral blood, while sero-positive normal donors and other surgical patients
      did not exhibit detectable virus, suggesting either a systemic reactivation of
      HCMV within patients with GBM or shedding of viral DNA from infected tumor cells 
      into the periphery. These results confirm the association of HCMV with malignant 
      gliomas and demonstrate that subclinical HCMV viremia (presence of viral DNA in
      blood without clinical symptoms of infection) is a previously unrecognized
      disease spectrum in patients with GBM.

TI  - Bevacizumab plus irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 4722-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The prognosis for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme is
      poor, with a median survival of 3 to 6 months. We performed a phase II trial of
      bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, in
      combination with irinotecan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase II trial included
      two cohorts of patients. The initial cohort, comprising 23 patients, received
      bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg plus irinotecan every 2 weeks. The dose of irinotecan was
      based on the patient's anticonvulsant: Patients taking enzyme-inducing
      antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) received 340 mg/m2, and patients not taking EIAEDs
      received 125 mg/m2. After this regimen was deemed safe and effective, the
      irinotecan schedule was changed to an accepted brain tumor regimen of four doses 
      in 6 weeks, in anticipation of a phase III randomized trial of irinotecan versus 
      irinotecan and bevacizumab. The second cohort, comprising 12 patients, received
      bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days and irinotecan on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Each 
      cycle was 6 weeks long and concluded with patient evaluations, including magnetic
      resonance imaging. RESULTS: The 6-month progression-free survival among all 35
      patients was 46% (95% CI, 32% to 66%). The 6-month overall survival was 77% (95% 
      CI, 64% to 92%). Twenty of the 35 patients (57%; 95% CI, 39% to 74%) had at least
      a partial response. One patient developed a CNS hemorrhage, which occurred in his
      10th cycle. Four patients developed thromboembolic complications (deep venous
      thrombosis and/or pulmonary emboli). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab and irinotecan is an
      effective treatment for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme and has moderate
      toxicity.

TI  - Targeted UV therapy in the treatment of psoriasis.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) light is an effective treatment for extensive psoriasis and some
      other inflammatory skin conditions. Because the predominant effect of UV is a
      local one (as opposed to a systemic effect on immunity), localized delivery of
      ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) may be a useful treatment for localized variants of
      psoriasis and other conditions. The article reviews the literature regarding use 
      of localized UV therapy. A theoretical benefit of localized UV therapy is reduced
      toxicity compared with whole-body therapy. Practical benefits in psoriasis
      treatment include higher efficacy and more appealing cosmesis compared with
      topicals. The 308-nm excimer laser is effective for psoriasis with fewer UVB
      treatments and lower total UVB exposure than needed for total body UV treatment. 
      Other methods of localized UV delivery include quartz lamps, hand-held home UV
      devices, and non-laser intense photo sources. Other conditions treated with
      localized UV include vitiligo and lichen planus. Localized UV therapy is a useful
      modality for the treatment of localized variants of psoriasis with growing use
      for other dermatologic diseases.

TI  - Second messenger systems in human gliomas.
PG  - 1585-90
AB  - CONTEXT: Patients with glioblastoma (astrocytoma, World Health Organization grade
      IV) exhibit 2-year survival rates of less than 20% despite significant advances
      in therapeutic options available to patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) hyperexpression is one of the most commonly encountered abnormalities in
      this tumor. However, EGFR expression, amplification, and mutations are poorly
      predictive of patient survival. Investigators have taken to exploiting the
      sensitivities of activated downstream targets in the EGFR second messenger
      pathways to certain inhibitory drugs to downregulate their neoplastic messages
      promoting cell growth and inhibiting cell death. OBJECTIVE: It is important to
      both gain some understanding of the functional significance of these pathways and
      to understand the role the pathologist might play in characterizing the
      activation status of certain downstream messenger proteins that are targeted in
      these brain tumor therapies. We have reviewed the literature regarding histologic
      assays that have been incorporated into trials of these new drugs and report on
      the methods used to study these proteins and the conclusions of these studies.
      DATA SOURCES: Literature review and primary material from Duke University
      (Durham, NC) Department of Pathology archives. CONCLUSIONS: To date, drug trial
      reports indicate that identification of the presence of the EGFR variant,
      EGFRvIII, and measurement of the activated downstream targets, phospho-Akt,
      phospho-S6, and phospho-MAPK, may be useful in predicting sensitivity to some of 
      the EGFR kinase inhibitors. No studies to date have identified prognostic
      significance related to immunoreactivity status among any of these markers that
      is independent of histologic grade.

TI  - Optical coherence tomography as a tool for monitoring pediatric pseudotumor
      cerebri.
PG  - 564-70
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness in children 
      with pseudotumor cerebri. METHODS: Prospective observational series of children
      with pseudotumor cerebri compared against controls matched for age and gender. We
      included 11 pediatric subjects with clinical pseudotumor cerebri and 37 normal
      controls. Subjects underwent a complete eye examination including stereo disk
      photographs and OCT. Peripapillary RNFL and macular thickness were evaluated
      using the Stratus OCT 3000. The peripapillary RNFL was evaluated with two
      protocols: Fast RNFL Map protocol with values divided in eight sections, made up 
      of four quadrants, each with an inner and outer ring, and Fast RNFL Thickness
      (3.4) protocol, using values presented for four quadrants. A Fast Macular
      Thickness Map was also obtained, and results reported similarly included eight
      sections, made up of four quadrants, each with an inner and outer ring. RESULTS: 
      The Fast RNFL Map protocol showed an increased RNFL thickness (pseudotumor
      cerebri vs controls) in the temporal and superior quadrants. The Fast RNFL
      Thickness (3.4) protocol showed a thicker average RNFL for pseudotumor cerebri
      eyes compared with controls (125.7 vs 106.5 microm, p < 0.0001). The Fast Macular
      Thickness Map showed an increased RNFL thickness in the nasal quadrant for the
      inner ring. The macular volumes for pseudotumor cerebri versus control eyes were 
      7.21 versus 6.97 mm(3), respectively (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: OCT shows
      increased RNFL and macular thickness in pseudotumor cerebri and may be a useful
      clinical tool in these children.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy of pilomyxoid astrocytomas: case
      reports and comparison with pilocytic astrocytomas.
PG  - 682-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilomyxoid astrocytomas (PMAs) have been described only
      recently. They appear as low-grade tumors sharing imaging features similar to
      pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs). However, pilomyxoid astrocytomas have different
      histological features and behave more aggressively than PAs. We present the
      imaging and proton spectroscopic (magnetic resonance spectroscopy; MRS) findings 
      in 3 patients with PMA and compare them with those of PA arising in other sites. 
      METHODS: Three patients who later proved to harbor PMA were studied with MR
      imaging and multivolume MRS. We analyzed the imaging findings, with attention to 
      location, size, signal intensities, pattern of enhancement, and edema. In
      addition, we analyzed the MRS, with attention to the peaks of choline (Cho),
      creatine (Cr), N-acetyl aspartate, lipids, lactate, and myoinositol, and ratios
      between these metabolites. We compared the MRS studies of PMA with those of PA
      located in the hypothalamus and brain stem. RESULTS: In 2 patients, the PMAs were
      located in the chiasmatic-hypothalamic and third-ventricular-hypothalamic
      regions, showing solid enhancement, high T2 signal intensity, and hydrocephalus. 
      One PMA was found in the right parietal lobe showing a well-defined mass without 
      enhancement and high T2 signal intensity. The 2 PMAs showed high Cho/Cr ratios in
      peritumoral regions at long echo time in comparison with PA. A third PMA showed
      slight elevation of Cho/Cr ratio in peritumoral regions and no elevation of
      Cho/Cr ratios within the mass when compared with a PA. Short echo time MRS
      obtained in 2 PMAs showed low myoinositol/Cr ratios in tumoral regions in
      comparison with PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our 2 PMAs showed imaging features similar to
      those described in the literature. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed
      elevated Cho/Cr outside their enhancing margins, which may be related to their
      more aggressive behavior when compared with PA. The third PMA was different to
      those previously reported in the literature because it was hemispheric rather
      than hypothalamic in location in addition to having low intratumoral ratios of
      Cho/Cr.

TI  - Potassium management in pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients: can a diet with
      increased potassium maintain a normal serum potassium without a potassium
      supplement?
PG  - 167-9
AB  - Hypokalemia can result from an absence of cellular redistribution accompanied by 
      low serum potassium levels, which can be secondary to inadequate dietary intake, 
      external losses (for example, through the gut or skin), or renal losses. However,
      low serum potassium secondary to low potassium ingestion usually occurs after an 
      extended period of low oral potassium intake. Also, increased renal potassium
      excretion can be the result of magnesium deficiency. As compared with pediatric
      patients on hemodialysis, patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) are at increased
      risk of hypokalemia because of the greater filtration of potassium in PD. At the 
      same time, 90% of pediatric dialysis patients under the age of 8 years are on PD.

TI  - Determinants of PF4/heparin immunogenicity.
PG  - 4253-60
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated disorder that
      occurs with variable frequency in patients exposed to heparin. HIT antibodies
      preferentially recognize large macromolecular complexes formed between PF4 and
      heparin over a narrow range of molar ratios, but the biophysical properties of
      complexes that initiate antibody production are unknown. To identify structural
      determinants underlying PF4/heparin immunogenicity, we characterized the in vitro
      interactions of murine PF4 (mPF4) and heparin with respect to light absorption,
      size, and surface charge (zeta potential). We show that PF4/heparin
      macromolecular assembly occurs through colloidal interactions, wherein heparin
      facilitates the growth of complexes through charge neutralization. The size of
      PF4/heparin macromolecules is governed by the molar ratios of the reactants.
      Maximal complex size occurs at molar ratios of PF4/heparin at which surface
      charge is neutral. When mice are immunized with complexes that differ in size
      and/or zeta potential, antibody formation varies inversely with heparin
      concentration and is most robust in animals immunized with complexes displaying a
      net positive zeta-potential. These studies suggest that the clinical
      heterogeneity in the HIT immune response may be due in part to requirements for
      specific biophysical parameters of the PF4/heparin complexes that occur in
      settings of intense platelet activation and PF4 release.

      patients.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be a common problem 
      associated with the treatment of acute brain injury. High frequency oscillatory
      ventilation (HFOV) is a developing therapy for the treatment of ARDS in adult
      patients that can be life saving. However, often patients with acute, severe
      brain injury demonstrate intracranial hypertension (hICP) due to a variety of
      injuries (e.g., traumatic brain injury, mass lesion, acute hydrocephalus). There 
      is concern over the use of HFOV due to its effects on intracranial pressure in
      patients with hICP. METHODS: Retrospective case series study. RESULTS: We
      describe the effects of HFOV on hemodynamics, respiratory function, and
      intracranial pressure in five patients with acute brain injury being treated for 
      ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: HFOV did not cause unmanageable or sustained increases in ICP 
      in our series of patients. It appears HFOV may be a relatively safe and effective
      means of oxygenating patients with severe ARDS and concomitant hICP secondary to 
      acute brain injury.

TI  - Microvillus inclusion disease: progressive mucosal pathology. A scanning and
      transmission electron microscopic study, and thoughts about possible
      pathogenesis.
PG  - 125-36
AB  - An infant of African-American descent presented in the immediate newborn period
      with secretory diarrhea, the cause of which turned out to be microvillus
      inclusion disease (MID). Small intestinal mucosal biopsies at 6 weeks of age were
      diagnostic for MID by electron microscopy and repeat biopsies from the small
      intestine at 15 months demonstrated the seeming relentless progression of this
      disorder, when a normal structure and organization of small intestinal mucosa was
      no longer recognizable. Since the child could not tolerate any form of enteral
      nutrition, a small intestinal transplant was contemplated, but could not be done.
      The patient did not survive the consequences of an overwhelming sepsis, which
      resulted in multi-organ failure.

TI  - When half is not enough: gene expression and dosage in the 22q11 deletion
      syndrome.
PG  - 299-310
AB  - The 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS, also known as DiGeorge or
      Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome) has a variable constellation of phenotypes including
      life-threatening cardiac malformations, craniofacial, limb, and digit anomalies, 
      a high incidence of learning, language, and behavioral disorders, and increased
      vulnerability for psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. There is still
      little clear understanding of how heterozygous microdeletion of approximately
      30-50 genes on chromosome 22 leads to this diverse spectrum of phenotypes,
      especially in the brain. Three possibilities exist: 1) 22q11DS may reflect
      haploinsufficiency, homozygous loss of function, or heterozygous gain of function
      of a single gene within the deleted region; 2) 22q11DS may result from
      haploinsufficiency, homozygous loss of function, or heterozygous gain of function
      of a few genes in the deleted region acting at distinct phenotypically
      compromised sites; 3) 22q11DS may reflect combinatorial effects of reduced dosage
      of multiple genes acting in concert at all phenotypically compromised sites.
      Here, we consider evidence for each of these possibilities. Our review of the
      literature, as well as interpretation of work from our laboratory, favors the
      third possibility: 22q11DS reflects diminished expression of multiple 22q11 genes
      acting on common cellular processes during brain as well as heart, face, and limb
      development, and subsequently in the adolescent and adult brain.

TI  - Idiopathic IgA nephropathy: pathogenesis, histopathology, and therapeutic
      options.
PG  - 1054-61
AB  - IgA nephropathy is one of the most common causes of glomerulonephritis in the
      world. Proliferative and crescentic forms of IgA are found in up to 30% of cases 
      and are associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria, accelerated hypertension,
      and accelerated decline toward ESRD. Despite its prevalence and clinical
      importance, there is no unifying nomenclature or consensus for the treatment of
      specific histologic subgroups. As a consequence, the development of clinically
      effective treatment regimens for IgA nephropathy have lagged behind other, less
      common forms of glomerulonephritis. Herein is reviewed the pathogenesis and
      histologic subtypes of IgA nephropathy and how conventional and immunosuppressive
      therapies have an impact on renal survival and recurrence rates. The use of known
      clinical risk factors for disease progression in conjunction with specific
      histologic features can be a guide to both induction and consolidation therapies 
      for individual patients with IgA nephropathy.

TI  - Hygromas after endoscopic third ventriculostomy in the first year of life:
      incidence, management and outcome in a series of 34 patients.
PG  - 57-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overdrainage in shunted patients is a known predisposing factor for
      the formation of hygromas, but little is known about risk factors in endoscopic
      third ventriculocisternostomy (ETV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively
      analysed data of 34 patients younger than 1 year with obstructive hydrocephalus, 
      undergoing ETV, with respect to incidence, management, outcome and possible risk 
      factors for the formation of hygromas. Hygromas were arbitrarily defined as a
      collection of cerebrospinal fluid of more than 10 mm in diameter over the
      paramedian hemispheric convexities, diagnosed by ultrasonography. RESULTS: They
      occurred in 9 of 34 (26%) patients 3 to 28 days after ETV. They were on the
      operated side in four and bi-lateral in five cases. There was no relevant age
      difference between patients with hygromas (median 127 days) and those without
      hygromas (median 166 days). Etiology of obstructive hydrocephalus had no impact
      on the frequency of hygromas. Hygromas occurred somewhat less frequently when a
      paediatric endoscope with an outer diameter of 3 mm was used for ETV instead of
      an endoscope with a diameter of 6 mm. Hygromas were asymptomatic and
      conservatively managed in five cases; 4 of 34 (12%) patients underwent surgery
      because of clinical symptoms of increasing intracranial pressure or increasing
      hygroma diameter. Two patients were treated with a temporary external drainage
      only and another two patients with an external drainage first and eventually a
      subduro-peritoneal shunt. There were no neurological long-term sequelae.
      CONCLUSION: Clear predisposing factors for the formation of hygromas could not be
      identified, but the outer diameter of the endoscope may play a role.

AB  - Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which T cells recognize and destroy
      melanocytes. We present a case of a 20-year-old male who developed generalized
      vitiligo 4 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for Fanconi
      anemia. Although other autoimmune conditions have been well characterized as
      post-BMT complications, vitiligo is very rare. We review the 9 previously
      reported cases of post-BMT vitiligo.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of palliative surgery including a systemic-to-pulmonary artery 
      shunt in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease: does aspirin make a
      difference?
PG  - 293-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin (ASA) often is used to prevent thrombosis in infants with
      congenital heart disease after placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt,
      but its effect on outcomes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present
      multicenter study prospectively collected data on 1-year postoperative rates of
      death, shunt thrombosis, or hospitalization age <4 months for bidirectional
      Glenn/hemi-Fontan surgery in 1004 infants. The use and dose of ASA were recorded.
      Kaplan-Meier event rates were calculated for each event and the composite
      outcome, and a Cox regression model was constructed for time to event. Model
      terms were ASA use and type of surgery, with adjustment for age at surgery.
      Diagnoses were hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n=346), tricuspid atresia
      (n=103), tetralogy of Fallot (n=127), pulmonary atresia (n=177), heterotaxy
      syndrome (n=38), and other (n=213). There were 344 shunts placed without
      cardiopulmonary bypass (closed shunt), 287 shunts with bypass (open shunt), 323
      Norwood procedures, and 50 Sano procedures. Overall, 80% of patients received
      ASA. One-year postoperative events rates were high: 38% for the composite end
      point, 26% for death, and 12% for shunt thrombosis. After the exclusion of
      patients with early mortality, patients receiving ASA had a lower risk of shunt
      thrombosis (hazard ratio, 0.13; P=0.008) and death (closed shunt: hazard ratio,
      0.41, P=0.057; open shunt: hazard ratio, 0.10, P<0.001; Norwood: hazard ratio,
      0.34, P<0.001; Sano: hazard ratio, 0.68, P=NS) compared with those not receiving 
      ASA. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity and mortality for infants after surgical
      placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt are high. ASA appears to lower 
      the risk of death and shunt thrombosis in the present observational study.

TI  - Stephen L. Gans Distinguished Overseas Lecture. The neural crest in pediatric
      surgery.
PG  - 915-26
AB  - AIM: This review highlights the relevance of the neural crest (NC) as a
      developmental control mechanism involved in several pediatric surgical conditions
      and the investigative interest of following some of its known signaling pathways.
      METHODS: The participation of the NC in facial clefts, ear defects, branchial
      fistulae and cysts, heart outflow tract and aortic arch anomalies, pigmentary
      disorders, abnormal enteric innervation, neural tumors, hemangiomas, and vascular
      anomalies is briefly reviewed. Then, the literature on clinical and experimental 
      esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF) and congenital
      diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is reviewed for the presence of associated NC defects.
      Finally, some of the molecular signaling pathways involved in both conditions
      (sonic hedgehog, Hox genes, and retinoids) are summarized. RESULTS: The
      association of facial, cardiovascular, thymic, parathyroid, and C-cell defects
      together with anomalies of extrinsic and intrinsic esophageal innervation in
      babies and/or animals with both EA-TEF and CDH strongly supports the hypothesis
      that NC is involved in the pathogenesis of these malformative clusters. On the
      other hand, both EA-TEF and CDH are observed in mice mutant for genes involved in
      the previously mentioned signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of
      NC-related molecular pathogenic pathways involved in malformative associations
      like EA-TEF and CDH that are induced by chromosomal anomalies, chemical
      teratogens, and engineered mutations is a promising way of clarifying why and how
      some pediatric surgical conditions occur. Pediatric surgeons should be actively
      involved in these investigations.

TI  - Genetic causes of bronchiectasis: primary ciliary dyskinesia.
PG  - 252-63
AB  - Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder
      reflecting abnormalities in the structure and function of motile cilia and
      flagella, causing impairment of mucociliary clearance, left-right body asymmetry,
      and sperm motility. Clinical manifestations include respiratory distress in term 
      neonates, recurrent otosinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, situs inversus
      and/or heterotaxy, and male infertility. Genetic discoveries are emerging from
      family-based linkage studies and from testing candidate genes. Mutations in 2
      genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5, frequently cause PCD as an autosomal recessive disorder. 
      A clinical genetic test has been recently established for DNAI1 and DNAH5, which 
      involves sequencing 9 exons that harbor the most common mutations. This approach 
      will identify at least one mutation in these 2 genes in approximately 25% of PCD 
      patients. If biallelic mutations are identified, the test is diagnostic. If only 
      one mutation is identified, the full gene may be sequenced to search for a
      trans-allelic mutation. As more disease-causing gene mutations are identified,
      broader genetic screening panels will further identify patients with PCD. Ongoing
      investigations are beginning to identify genetic mutations in novel clinical
      phenotypes for PCD, such as congenital heart disease and male infertility, and
      new associations are being established between 'ciliary' genetic mutations and
      clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Congenital heart disease and other heterotaxic defects in a large cohort of
      patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
PG  - 2814-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a recessive genetic disorder that
      is characterized by sinopulmonary disease and reflects abnormal ciliary structure
      and function. Situs inversus totalis occurs in approximately 50% of PCD patients 
      (Kartagener's syndrome in PCD), and there are a few reports of PCD with
      heterotaxy (situs ambiguus), such as cardiovascular anomalies. Advances in
      diagnosis of PCD, such as genetic testing, allow the systematic investigation of 
      this association. METHODS AND RESULTS: The prevalence of heterotaxic defects was 
      determined in 337 PCD patients by retrospective review of radiographic and
      ultrasound data. Situs solitus (normal situs) and situs inversus totalis were
      identified in 46.0% and 47.7% of patients, respectively, and 6.3% (21 patients)
      had heterotaxy. As compared with patients with situs solitus, those with situs
      abnormalities had more ciliary outer dynein arm defects, fewer inner dynein arm
      and central apparatus defects (P<0.001), and more mutations in ciliary outer
      dynein arm genes (DNAI1 and DNAH5; P=0.022). Seven of 12 patients with heterotaxy
      who were genotyped had mutations in DNAI1 or DNAH5. Twelve patients with
      heterotaxy had cardiac and/or vascular abnormalities, and most (8 of 12 patients)
      had complex congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: At least 6.3% of patients with
      PCD have heterotaxy, and most of those have cardiovascular abnormalities. The
      prevalence of congenital heart disease with heterotaxy is 200-fold higher in PCD 
      than in the general population (1:50 versus 1:10 000); thus, patients with PCD
      should have cardiac evaluation. Conversely, mutations in genes that adversely
      affect both respiratory and embryological nodal cilia are a significant cause of 
      heterotaxy and congenital heart disease, and screening for PCD is indicated in
      those patients.

TI  - Regulatory factor X4 variant 3: a transcription factor involved in brain
      development and disease.
PG  - 3515-22
AB  - Regulatory factor X4 variant 3 (RFX4_v3) is a recently identified transcription
      factor specifically expressed in the brain. Gene disruption in mice demonstrated 
      that interruption of a single allele (heterozygous, +/-) prevented formation of
      the subcommissural organ (SCO), resulting in congenital hydrocephalus, whereas
      interruption of two alleles (homozygous, -/-) caused fatal failure of dorsal
      midline brain structure formation. These mutagenesis studies implicated RFX4_v3
      in early brain development as well as the genesis of the SCO. Rfx4_v3 deficiency 
      presumably causes abnormalities in brain by altering the expression levels of
      many genes that are crucial for brain morphogenesis, such as the signaling
      components in the Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and retinoic acid pathways.
      RFX4_v3 might affect these critical signaling pathways in brain development.
      Cx3cl1, a chemokine gene highly expressed in brain, was identified as a direct
      target for RFX4_v3, indicating that RFX4_v3 possesses trans-acting activity to
      stimulate gene expression. Rfx4_v3 is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic
      nucleus and might be involved in regulating the circadian clock. One haplotype in
      RFX4_v3 gene is linked to a higher risk of bipolar disorder, suggesting that this
      protein might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. This Mini-Review
      describes our current knowledge about RFX4_v3, an important protein that appears 
      to be involved in many aspects of brain development and disease.

TI  - Obesity and the skin: skin physiology and skin manifestations of obesity.
PG  - 901-16; quiz 917-20
AB  - UNLABELLED: Obesity is widely recognized as an epidemic in the Western world;
      however, the impact of obesity on the skin has received minimal attention. The
      purpose of this article is to highlight the association between obesity and
      dermatologic conditions. We review the impact of obesity on the skin, including
      skin physiology, skin manifestations of obesity, and dermatologic diseases
      aggravated by obesity. Obesity is responsible for changes in skin barrier
      function, sebaceous glands and sebum production, sweat glands, lymphatics,
      collagen structure and function, wound healing, microcirculation and
      macrocirculation, and subcutaneous fat. Moreover, obesity is implicated in a wide
      spectrum of dermatologic diseases, including acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, 
      keratosis pilaris, hyperandrogenism and hirsutism, striae distensae, adiposis
      dolorosa, and fat redistribution, lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency,
      plantar hyperkeratosis, cellulitis, skin infections, hidradenitis suppurativa,
      psoriasis, insulin resistance syndrome, and tophaceous gout. We review the
      clinical features, evidence for association with obesity, and management of these
      various dermatoses and highlight the profound impact of obesity in clinical
      dermatology. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: After completing this learning activity,
      participants should be aware of obesity-associated changes in skin physiology,
      skin manifestations of obesity, and dermatologic diseases aggravated by obesity, 
      and be able to formulate a pathophysiology-based treatment strategy for
      obesity-associated dermatoses.

TI  - High-resolution CT of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
PG  - 1232-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-resolution CT is an important tool in the detection and
      management of bronchiectasis, but there is little information about
      high-resolution CT findings in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We analyzed all 
      high-resolution CT studies of the chest available for a cohort of PCD patients to
      identify an associated pattern of high-resolution CT changes. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: High-resolution CT studies were available for 45 PCD patients from 42
      families with ranges of age and disease severity. The images were assessed for
      severity and distribution of bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, mucous
      plugging, and other findings. A bronchiectasis severity score was calculated. CT 
      findings were correlated with phenotypic findings, including situs type, ciliary 
      ultrastructural defect, nasal level of nitric oxide, forced expiratory volume in 
      1 second, and microbiologic findings in the airways. RESULTS: Twenty-nine adults 
      (mean age, 42 +/- 15 years; age range, 21-73 years) and 16 children (mean age, 8 
      +/- 4 years; age range, 1-14 years) were included; 26 (58%) of the patients were 
      women or girls. Situs inversus totalis (38%) or heterotaxy (18%) was identified
      in 56% of the patients. A high (9%) prevalence of pectus excavatum was
      identified. High-resolution CT of all of the adult and 56% of the pediatric
      patients showed bronchiectasis in a predominantly middle and lower lobe
      distribution. The right middle lobe was most commonly involved. Bronchiectasis
      severity score correlated with older age and worse pulmonary function.
      CONCLUSION: High-resolution CT shows that pulmonary disease related to PCD
      predominantly involves the middle and lower lobes of the lungs. In adults,
      high-resolution CT findings negative for bronchiectasis may have a role in
      excluding the diagnosis of PCD. Correlation of severity of disease on
      high-resolution CT with patient phenotype gives further insight into the
      diversity and natural history of PCD.

TI  - Cerebral perfusion pattern of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus studied by
      SPECT and statistical brain mapping.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the specific pattern of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in
      subjects with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) using voxel-based
      analysis. METHODS: N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were performed in 30 iNPH patients,
      who met probable iNPH criteria, 30 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and 15 normal 
      control (NC) subjects. Inter-group comparisons between iNPH patients and NC
      subjects and between AD patients and NC subjects were performed using
      three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis. Individual
      3D-SSP images of the iNPH patients were assessed by visual inspection. RESULTS:
      On the Z-score maps, areas of relative hypoperfusion were recognized around the
      corpus callosum in all 30 iNPH patients, as well as in the Sylvian fissure
      regions in 19 of 30 iNPH patients which included artifacts by dilated ventricles 
      and the Sylvian fissures. Ten frontal dominant, eight parietotemporal dominant,
      and 12 diffuse hypoperfusion types were demonstrated. Inter-group comparison
      between iNPH and NC subjects showed relative hypoperfusion in the frontal and
      parietotemporal areas and severe hypoperfusion around the corpus callosum and
      Sylvian fissure regions, while parietotemporal and posterior cingulate CBF
      reduction was demonstrated between the AD and NC groups. CONCLUSION: Voxel-based 
      analysis showed a characteristic pattern of regional CBF reduction with frontal
      dominant or diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion accompanying severe hypoperfusion
      around the corpus callosum and Sylvian fissures with artifacts.

TI  - Sildenafil improves walk distance in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 897-899

LID - 10.1378/chest.06-2101 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension is a common finding in patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therapy
      with sildenafil has been shown to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in
      patients with pulmonary fibrosis and may improve functional status. Patients with
      IPF and documented pulmonary hypertension were followed up in an open-label study
      of sildenafil. The 6-min walk test distance (6MWD) was obtained before and after 
      3 months of sildenafil therapy. Fourteen patients were followed up in the study; 
      11 patients completed both 6-min walk tests. The mean improvement in walk
      distance was 49.0 m (90% confidence interval, 17.5 to 84.0 m). When all 14
      patients were dichotomized into groups of "responders" (ie, >/= 20% improvement
      in 6MWD) or "nonresponders" (ie, < 20% change or unable to complete), 57% were
      classified as responders. Sildenafil is a promising and well-tolerated
      therapeutic agent for use in patients with IPF and pulmonary hypertension, and
      should be studied in a large, well-controlled trial.

TI  - GABA(A) receptor alpha5 subunit as a candidate gene for autism and bipolar
      disorder: a proposed endophenotype with parent-of-origin and gain-of-function
      features,with or without oculocutaneous albinism.
PG  - 135-47
AB  - Our earlier family history studies of individuals with autism found a high
      incidence of major affective disorder, especially bipolar disorder, and unusual
      talents or intellectual abilities among family members. We now describe a
      subgroup of such families, selected from a large clinical experience,
      illustrating specific features of major affective disorder, special talents or
      intellectual ability, and familial patterns of trait transmission, with the
      additional feature of oculocutaneous albinism in some cases. These observations, 
      suggesting parent-of-origin and gain-of-function effects, considered together
      with recent genetic findings in the literature, suggest a genetic hypothesis
      possibly unifying disparate observations found in families of individuals with
      autism.

TI  - Complications of sclerotherapy.
PG  - 22-8
AB  - Sclerotherapy is the systematic, targeted elimination of intracutaneous and
      subcutaneous varicose, reticular, telangiectasias by the injection of a locally
      irritating chemical substance, called a sclerosant. The endpoint of this process 
      is functionally analogous to surgical removal of a vein. However, regardless of
      the best of intentions, complications can and will occur with enough
      sclerotherapy treatments. Complications resulting from sclerotherapy can be
      divided into the following categories for ease of explanation: (1) frequent but
      transient, (2) rare but self-limited, and (3) rare but major. This article will
      focus on select complications in sclerotherapy, review the most common
      complications observed, and discuss how to minimize these in daily practice.

TI  - Temozolomide in children with progressive low-grade glioma.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - We conducted a phase II study to assess the efficacy of oral temozolomide (TMZ)
      in children with progressive low-grade glioma. Thirty eligible patients were
      enrolled on this study. Median age at enrollment was 10 years (range, 4-18
      years). Eligible patients received TMZ (200 mg/m(2) per day) by mouth for five
      days every four weeks. Patients received a median of nine cycles (range, 2-12
      cycles) of treatment. Best responses in the 26 patients (86%) with optic pathway 
      glioma (OPG)/pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) included partial response in 3 patients
      (11%), minor response in 1 (4%), stable disease in 10 (38%), and progressive
      disease in 12 (46%). Only one of four patients with fibrillary astrocytoma had
      stable disease for 29 months after TMZ. The overall disease stabilization rate in
      patients with OPG/PA was 54%, and disease control was maintained for a median
      interval of 34 months. Seventeen of 26 patients had progressive disease either on
      or off therapy, and three have died of disease. The two-year progression-free and
      overall survivals in patients with OPG/PA were 49% (95% CI, 30%-67%) and 96% (95%
      CI, 89%-100%), respectively. Worst toxicity related to TMZ in all 30 patients
      included grade 2-4 thrombocytopenia in seven patients, grade 2-4 neutropenia in
      seven, grade 2 skin rash in one, and intratumor hemorrhage in one. TMZ given in
      this schedule was successful in stabilizing disease in a significant proportion
      of the patients with OPG/PA, with manageable toxicity.

TI  - Cerebellopontine angle craniopharyngioma: case report and literature review.
PG  - 158-63
AB  - The authors report an unusual case of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma
      occurring in isolation in the cerebellopontine angle of a 12-year-old female. The
      patient presented with a 1-year history of nausea, vomiting, and headache. MRI
      revealed a left cerebellopontine angle tumor without connection to the
      suprasellar space. Following near-total resection, histological review confirmed 
      the lesion as an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. This is only the third
      published report of craniopharyngioma occurring in isolation in the
      cerebellopontine angle. The case report and a brief review of the literature are 
      presented.

TI  - Review of 54 patients with complete DiGeorge anomaly enrolled in protocols for
      thymus transplantation: outcome of 44 consecutive transplants.
PG  - 4539-47
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize a large group of infants with
      complete DiGeorge anomaly and to evaluate the ability of thymus transplantation
      to reconstitute immune function in these infants. DiGeorge anomaly is
      characterized by varying defects of the heart, thymus, and parathyroid glands.
      Complete DiGeorge anomaly refers to the subgroup that is athymic (< 1%). The
      characteristics of 54 subjects at presentation and results from 44 consecutive
      thymus transplantations are reported. Remarkably, only 52% had 22q11 hemizygosity
      and only 57% had congenital heart disease requiring surgery. Thirty-one percent
      developed an atypical phenotype with rash and lymphadenopathy. To date, 33 of 44 
      subjects who received a transplant survive (75%) with post-transplantation
      follow-up as long as 13 years. All deaths occurred within 12 months of
      transplantation. All 25 subjects who were tested 1 year after transplantation had
      developed polyclonal T-cell repertoires and proliferative responses to mitogens. 
      Adverse events developing after transplantation included hypothyroidism in 5
      subjects and enteritis in 1 subject. In summary, diagnosis of complete DiGeorge
      anomaly is challenging because of the variability of presentation. Thymus
      transplantation was well tolerated and resulted in stable immunoreconstitution in
      these infants.

TI  - Evaluation of the elderly patient with an abnormal gait.
PG  - 107-17
AB  - Distinguishing between the normal gait of the elderly and pathologic gaits is
      often difficult. Pathologic gaits with neurologic causes include frontal gait,
      spastic hemiparetic gait, parkinsonian gait, cerebellar ataxic gait, and sensory 
      ataxic gait. Pathologic gaits with combined neurologic and musculoskeletal causes
      include myelopathic gait, stooped gait of lumbar spinal stenosis, and steppage
      gait. Pathologic gaits with musculoskeletal causes include antalgic gait,
      coxalgic gait, Trendelenburg gait, knee hyperextension gait, and other gaits
      caused by inadequate joint mobility. A working knowledge of the characteristics
      of these gaits and a systematic approach to observational gait examination can
      help identify the causes of abnormal gait. Patients with abnormal gait can
      benefit from the treatment of the primary cause of the disorder as well as by
      general fall-prevention interventions. Treatable causes of gait disturbance are
      found in a substantial proportion of patients and include normal-pressure
      hydrocephalus, vitamin B(12) deficiency, Parkinson's disease, alcoholism,
      medication toxicity, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, lumbar spinal stenosis,
      joint contractures, and painful disorders of the lower extremity.

TI  - Genetic mechanisms of susceptibility to oxidative lung injury in mice.
PG  - 433-45
AB  - Genetic background is a known predisposing risk factor for many acute and chronic
      pulmonary disorders and responses to environmental oxidants. Variation in lung
      injury responses to oxidative stimuli such as ozone, particles, hyperoxia, and
      chemotherapeutic agents between genetically standardized inbred mouse strains has
      been demonstrated. In this review, we discuss quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
      which contain candidate genes that confer differential susceptibility to
      oxidative stimuli between strains in mouse models of airway toxicity and disease.
      We addressed multiple inflammatory, immunity, and antioxidant genes identified as
      candidate genetic determinants following these strategies, which include tumor
      necrosis factor (Tnf), toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), and the transcription factor 
      NF-E2, related factor 2 (Nrf2). Mice with targeted deletion of these and related 
      genes have provided initial proof of concept for their importance in the
      respective models. Interestingly, a few regions of the genome appear to have
      important roles in determining susceptibility to a number of stimuli which may
      suggest common genetic mechanisms in mice. Though more complete examination of
      functional association is required, results have potential implications for the
      role of these candidate genes in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary diseases
      including asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and emphysema.

TI  - Noninfectious complications of peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - Peritoneal dialysis is an established form of renal replacement therapy. With its
      increasing popularity, we are now encountering a variety of complications.
      Noninfectious complications are usually less common as compared with infectious
      complications. In this review, we discuss some of the common noninfectious
      complications of peritoneal dialysis such as hernias, hydrothorax,
      hemoperitoneum, pancreatitis, ischemic colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis,
      pneumoperitoneum, GERD, subcapsular steatosis and hypokalemia. The awareness of
      these complications will help in early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Phase II study of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea for recurrent grade III
      malignant gliomas.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent reports demonstrate the activity of imatinib mesylate, an
      ATP-mimetic, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, plus hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide
      reductase inhibitor, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. We
      performed the current phase 2 study to evaluate this regimen among patients with 
      recurrent WHO grade III malignant glioma (MG). PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients with
      grade III MG at any recurrence, received imatinib mesylate plus hydroxyurea (500 
      mg twice a day) orally on a continuous, daily schedule. The imatinib mesylate
      dose was 500 mg twice a day for patients on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs 
      (EIAEDs) and 400 mg once a day for those not on EIAEDs. Clinical assessments were
      performed monthly and radiographic assessments were obtained at least every 2
      months. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate.
      RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled. All patients had progressive disease
      after prior radiotherapy and at least temozolomide-based chemotherapy. The median
      number of episodes of prior progression was 2 (range, 1-7) and the median number 
      of prior treatment regimens was 3 (range, 1-8). With a median follow-up of 82.9
      weeks, 24% of patients were progression-free at 6 months. The radiographic
      response rate was 10%, while 33% achieved stable disease. Among patients who
      achieved at least stable disease at first evaluation, the 6-month and 12-month
      PFS rates were 53% and 29%, respectively. The most common grade 3 or greater
      toxicities were hematologic and complicated less than 4% of administered courses.
      CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate plus hydroxyurea, is well tolerated and associated 
      with anti-tumor activity in some patients with recurrent grade 3 MG.

TI  - Model systems for the study of heart development and disease. Cardiac neural
      crest and conotruncal malformations.
PG  - 101-10
AB  - Neural crest cells are multipotential cells that delaminate from the dorsal
      neural tube and migrate widely throughout the body. A subregion of the cranial
      neural crest originating between the otocyst and somite 3 has been called
      "cardiac neural crest" because of the importance of these cells in heart
      development. Much of what we know about the contribution and function of the
      cardiac neural crest in cardiovascular development has been learned in the chick 
      embryo using quail-chick chimeras to study neural crest migration and derivatives
      as well as using ablation of premigratory neural crest cells to study their
      function. These studies show that cardiac neural crest cells are absolutely
      required to form the aorticopulmonary septum dividing the cardiac arterial pole
      into systemic and pulmonary circulations. They support the normal development and
      patterning of derivatives of the caudal pharyngeal arches and pouches, including 
      the great arteries and the thymus, thyroid and parathyroids. Recently, cardiac
      neural crest cells have been shown to modulate signaling in the pharynx during
      the lengthening of the outflow tract by the secondary heart field. Most of the
      genes associated with cardiac neural crest function have been identified using
      mouse models. These studies show that the neural crest cells may not be the
      direct cause of abnormal cardiovascular development but they are a major
      component in the complex tissue interactions in the caudal pharynx and outflow
      tract. Since, cardiac neural crest cells span from the caudal pharynx into the
      outflow tract, they are especially susceptible to any perturbation in or by other
      cells in these regions. Thus, understanding congenital cardiac outflow
      malformations in human sequences of malformations as represented by the DiGeorge 
      syndrome will necessarily require understanding development of the cardiac neural
      crest.

      and SMA-560 tumor cells grown in monolayer culture or intracranially in syngeneic
      immunocompetent or immunocompromised hosts in order to determine whether tumors
      grown in vitro recreate the complex genetic regulation that occurs in vivo. Our
      findings support our hypothesis that glioma phenotype in vitro may be quite
      different in vivo and significantly altered by in situ growth factors and other
      invading cell populations.

TI  - Phase II study of Cloretazine for the treatment of adults with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 70-4
AB  - Cloretazine (VNP40101M) is a newly synthesized alkylating agent belonging to a
      novel class of alkylating agents called 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydrazines. Agents that 
      belong to this class do not produce vinylating and chloroethylating species, and 
      hence this class of alkylating agents is thought to have minimal systemic
      toxicity. Cloretazine produces two short-lived active species:
      1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl) hydrazine (a chloroethylating species) 
      and a thiophilic carbamoylating methylisocyanate species. The chloroethylating
      species preferentially produces lesions at the O(6) position of guanine. The
      methylisocyanate species may inhibit O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, an
      important mechanism of resistance against alkylating agents. The purpose of this 
      study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of Cloretazine in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The basis for the determination of
      efficacy was the proportion of patients alive without evidence of disease
      progression six months after initiation of treatment. Patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme received Cloretazine (300 mg/m(2)) intravenously every
      six weeks. Radiographic response, survival data, and toxicity were assessed.
      Thirty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 years; 24 patients (75%)
      were men. At six months, two patients were alive and progression free, so the
      six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 6%. The median PFS was 6.3 weeks.
      There were no objective radiographic responses. Twelve patients had stable
      disease for at least one cycle, but only two patients received more than three
      cycles. Nine patients experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia and three patients
      experienced grade 4 neutropenia. Cloretazine administered every six weeks was
      relatively well tolerated, although this schedule has insignificant activity for 
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

TI  - Gene dosage in the developing and adult brain in a mouse model of 22q11 deletion 
      syndrome.
PG  - 412-28
AB  - We evaluated the consequences of heterozygous chromosome 22q11 deletion - a
      significant genetic risk for schizophrenia - for expression levels and patterns
      of a subset of 22q11 genes implicated in schizophrenia and other phenotypes in
      mouse models of 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). In deleted embryos, expression
      levels of at least nine 22q11 orthologues decline by 40-60% in the frontonasal
      mass/forebrain and other 22q11DS phenotypic sites (branchial and aortic arches,
      limb buds); however, coincident expression patterns of 22q11 and Snail genes -
      diagnostic for neural crest-derived mesenchyme - are unchanged, and Snail1
      expression levels do not decline. Subsequently, 22q11 mRNA levels are reduced by 
      40-60% in the brains of developing, adolescent and adult deleted mice without
      altered expression patterns, dysmorphology or reduced cell density. Apparently,
      in deleted individuals, 22q11 gene expression declines across otherwise stable
      cell populations, perhaps disrupting individual cell function via diminished
      dosage. Such changes might contribute to schizophrenia vulnerability in 22q11DS.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder: what does the evidence tell us?
PG  - 20-6
AB  - The treatment goals for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are to reduce fear,
      avoidance, physical distress, disability, and comorbidity. This review
      illustrates some of the primary studies used to evaluate efficacy of treatments
      for SAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine,
      sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram and the
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine are effective treatments.
      They have the additional benefit of being able to treat comorbid conditions. For 
      people who do not respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, treatment options
      include benzodiazepines (clonazepam, alprazolam, and bromazepam), alpha2delta
      calcium-channel blockers (gabapentin and pregabalin), reversible inhibitors of
      monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide, although agents in this class are not available
      in the United States), antiepileptics (levetiracetam), and atypical
      antipsychotics (olanzapine). The irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
      phenelzine can be considered an effective third-line therapy. Combination
      treatments may be beneficial, but more research is needed. Benefits of
      beta-blockers (propranolol and atenolol) are limited to performance anxiety.
      Botulinum toxin A may be an effective augmentation treatment option for severe
      axillary hyperhidrosis in patients with SAD. Studies show that patients with SAD 
      who are maintained on paroxetine, sertraline, or clonazepam have a low relapse
      rate.

TI  - Molecular regulation and physiology of the H+,K+ -ATPases in kidney.
PG  - 345-51
AB  - Two H(+), K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) proteins participate in K(+)
      absorption and H(+) secretion in the renal medulla. Both the gastric (HKalpha(1))
      and colonic (HKalpha(2)) H(+),K(+)-ATPases have been localized and characterized 
      by a number of techniques, and are known to be highly regulated in response to
      acid-base and electrolyte disturbances. Both ATPases are dimers of composition
      alpha/beta that localize to the apical membrane and both interact with the
      tetraspanin protein CD63. Although CD63 interacts with the carboxy-terminus of
      the alpha-subunit of the colonic H(+),K(+)-ATPase, it interacts with the
      beta-subunit of the gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase. Pharmacologically, both ATPases are
      distinct; for example, the gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase is inhibited by Sch-28080,
      but the colonic H(+),K(+)-ATPase is inhibited by ouabain (a classic inhibitor of 
      the Na(+)-pump) and is completely insensitive to Sch-28080. The alpha-subunit of 
      the colonic H(+),K(+)-ATPase is the only subunit of the X(+),K(+)-ATPase
      superfamily that has 3 different splice variants that emerge by deletion or
      elongation of the amino-terminus. The messenger RNA and protein of one of these
      splice variants (HKalpha(2C)) is specifically up-regulated in newborn rats and
      becomes undetectable in adult rats. Therefore, HKalpha(2), in addition to its
      role in potassium and acid-base homeostasis, appears to play a significant role
      in early growth and development. Finally, because chronic hypokalemia appears to 
      be the most potent stimulus for upregulation of HKalpha(2), we propose that the
      HKalpha(2) participates importantly in the maintenance of chronic metabolic
      alkalosis.

TI  - 3'-Deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: comparison with Gd-DTPA enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging.
PG  - 340-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The accumulation of 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine (FLT) on
      positron emission tomography (PET) images in patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme was evaluated and correlated with gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) 
      enhancement in magnetic resonance images (MRIs). METHODS: FLT studies in 10
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme were retrospectively
      investigated. Dynamic emission data were acquired for 60 minutes immediately
      after injection of FLT. The standardized uptake value (SUV) for tumor and
      reference tissue (contralateral hemisphere and ipsilateral cerebellum) was
      calculated. The volumes of the metabolically active part of the tumor (V (PET))
      and that of the Gd-DTPA enhancing part of the tumor (V (MR)) were calculated.
      RESULTS: FLT uptake in tumors peaked before 5 minutes and sometimes as early as
      0.5 minutes, and reached a constant level at approximately 10 minutes after
      injection. The reference tissue time-activity curves had an early peak and
      reached a constant low background level. All tumors had increased FLT uptake and 
      showed Gd-DTPA enhancement. The SUV in tumor was significantly higher than that
      in the reference tissue (P<0.0001). A significant correlation between V (PET) and
      V (MR) was found (P<0.0001) although there was a difference in the areas of
      Gd-DTPA enhancement and FLT uptake. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results
      indicate that FLT-PET may be useful for the detection of recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. Our data in a relatively small patient population do not support a
      clear-cut relationship between FLT accumulation and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Further 
      pathologic correlation will determine if it can be used for detecting recurrent
      tumoral disease.

TI  - Localized cervical pruritus as the presenting symptom of a spinal cord tumor.
PG  - 746-7
AB  - Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are rare in children. Presentation is usually
      with localized pain or motor deficits, and diagnosis can be delayed for months or
      years from the onset of symptoms. We present an unusual case of a 6-year-old girl
      who had an intramedullary cervical spinal cord astrocytoma. Her presenting
      symptom was right-sided cervical pruritus, which progressed to pain over the
      course of several months. Pruritus as a symptom of spinal cord pathology is
      discussed.

TI  - Local intracerebral administration of O(6)-benzylguanine combined with systemic
      chemotherapy with temozolomide of a patient suffering from a recurrent
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - The DNA repair protein O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a major
      determinant of methylating anticancer drug resistance. Inactivation of MGMT by
      pseudosubstrate inhibitors, such as O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)BG), sensitizes tumor
      cells to O(6)-alkylating agents. However, systemic administration of O(6)BG
      causes depletion of MGMT in all tissues of the body. Therefore, dose reduction of
      O(6)-alkylating drugs administered together with O(6)BG is required in order to
      avoid unwished toxic side effects. To attenuate the increased systemic toxicity
      caused by MGMT inhibitors, local MGMT inactivation would be desirable. Here, we
      report on intracerebral treatment with O(6)BG of a patient suffering from
      glioblastoma. O(6)BG was administered weekly in the tumor cavity by means of an
      Ommaya reservoir. This application was well tolerated. Concomitant treatment with
      temozolomide (Temodal) was associated with transient tumor stabilization without 
      detectable side effects. Although evidence is still lacking that local O(6)BG
      administration caused MGMT to be depleted in the residual tumor, the trial shows 
      that intracerebral treatment with O(6)BG is feasible. It might be a safe strategy
      for improving glioma therapy by treatment with temozolomide (and presumably also 
      other O(6)-alkylating drugs) concomitant with O(6)BG without augmenting
      drug-induced systemic side effects.

TI  - Gene expression profiling of familial and sporadic interstitial pneumonia.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and its familial variants are 
      progressive and largely untreatable disorders with poorly understood molecular
      mechanisms. Both the genetics and the histologic type of IIP play a role in the
      etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease, but transcriptional
      signatures of these subtypes are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate gene expression
      in the lung tissue of patients with usual interstitial pneumonia or nonspecific
      interstitial pneumonia that was either familial or nonfamilial in origin, and to 
      compare it with gene expression in normal lung parenchyma. METHODS: We profiled
      RNA from the lungs of 16 patients with sporadic IIP, 10 with familial IIP, and 9 
      normal control subjects on a whole human genome oligonucleotide microarray.
      RESULTS: Significant transcriptional differences exist in familial and sporadic
      IIPs. The genes distinguishing the genetic subtypes belong to the same functional
      categories as transcripts that distinguish IIP from normal samples. Relevant
      categories include chemokines and growth factors and their receptors, complement 
      components, genes associated with cell proliferation and death, and genes in the 
      Wnt pathway. The role of the chemokine CXCL12 in disease pathogenesis was
      confirmed in the murine bleomycin model of lung injury, with C57BL/6(CXCR4+/-)
      mice demonstrating significantly less collagen deposition than C57BL/6(CXCR4+/+) 
      mice. Whereas substantial differences exist between familial and sporadic IIPs,
      we identified only minor gene expression changes between usual interstitial
      pneumonia and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together,
      our findings indicate that differences in gene expression profiles between
      familial and sporadic IIPs may provide clues to the etiology and pathogenesis of 
      IIP.

TI  - Correlation of relative permeability and relative cerebral blood volume in
      high-grade cerebral neoplasms.
PG  - 1036-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to correlate the degree of contrast
      enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI and the relative
      cerebral blood volume (rCBV) values on T2*-weighted MRI in patients with
      high-grade brain neoplasms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with biopsy-proven
      high-grade gliomas underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using T1-weighted fast
      spoiled gradient-echo technique (TR/TE, 8.3/1.5) during i.v. infusion of 0.1
      mmol/kg of MR contrast medium. This sequence was followed within 5 minutes by
      dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging (1,500/80) during i.v. infusion of 
      0.2 mmol/kg of MR contrast medium. Dynamic contrast-enhanced analysis was
      performed using the maximum-signal-intensity algorithm, and DSC analysis was
      performed using the negative enhancement integral program. For each tumor, we
      performed two comparisons: first, the average dynamic contrast-enhanced and rCBV 
      values within a region of interest drawn around the entire contrast-enhancing
      tumor on a single image through the center of the lesion and, second, the highest
      dynamic contrast-enhanced and highest rCBV values within each tumor. Statistical 
      analyses of the first comparison were performed using Pearson's correlation
      coefficient, R2 correlation coefficient, and Spearman's rank correlation and for 
      the second comparison using Kendall's tau correlation. RESULTS: The mean signal
      intensity values ranged between 3.48 and 7.16 SDs above baseline values (mean,
      4.89 SDs). The mean rCBV values ranged between 57.9% and 122.7% of the normal
      lentiform nucleus (mean, 76.6%). The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.867,
      the R2 correlation coefficient was 0.752, and the Spearman's rank correlation was
      0.794 (p = 0.001). Dynamic contrast-enhanced values from the region of highest
      signal intensity ranged between 7.7 and 48.6 SDs above baseline values (mean,
      17.3 SDs). The highest rCBV values ranged between 105% and 400% of the normal
      lentiform nucleus (mean, 292%). The correlation was estimated to be 0.7778 and
      was statistically significant at the 0.01 level of statistical significance (p = 
      0.0035). CONCLUSION: We found a high correlation between degree of contrast
      enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced images and rCBV values in whole tumors
      and in regions having the highest degree of contrast enhancement in this small
      study. Our findings, which suggest that relative permeability and rCBV values may
      be correlated in high-grade glial neoplasms, deserve further study in a larger
      patient population.

TI  - Success and failure of endoscopic third ventriculostomy in young infants: are
      there different age distributions?
PG  - 1537-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient's age and etiology of hydrocephalus are the most important
      factors influencing the success rate of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
      Failure rates are reported to be particularly high in the first year of age. On
      the basis of our own data and a metaanalysis of the literature, we try to further
      define the impact of age on ETV success in infants younger than 1 year. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Only patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were considered.
      Between October 1994 and July 2004, 28 patients younger than 1 year underwent ETV
      in our institution. Age ranged from 8 to 311 days (median 96). The etiology of
      hydrocephalus was aqueductal stenosis (AS) in all patients (idiopathic in 13,
      posthemorrhagic in three, postmeningitic in four, and related to CNS or vascular 
      malformation or to tumor in eight). ETV failure was defined as subsequent need
      for shunt implantation. The metaanalysis of the literature took into account
      reported series on ETV in infants with detailed data on age and etiology in every
      single patient. RESULTS: In our own patients, ETV was successful in 13 patients
      and eventually failed in 15. In the ETV success group, the median age was 200
      days and the mean age was 176 days (range 13-311 days). In the ETV failure group,
      the ages were 105 days (median), 117 days (mean), and 8-299 days (range). The
      differences were not statistically significant. Age distributions in both outcome
      groups showed a tendency of failures to occur more frequently in the first 2-4
      months of life. The separate analysis of patients with idiopathic AS yielded
      similar figures and distributions. The data from the metaanalysis of the
      literature corresponded to our own results. CONCLUSION: There is a clear impact
      of age on ETV failure rate even when excluding etiological factors. The
      probability of ETV success gradually increases during the first months of life.
      The consequence of these findings for decision-making as well as parental
      counseling is to try to weigh the age of the infant and its estimated impact on
      ETV success with other factors guiding the decision to perform ETV or shunt in
      the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus.

      laser. Raman intensity measures the intensity of these individual bands. The
      Raman spectra of brain cancer cells was similar to those of normal cells, but the
      Raman intensity of cancer cells was much higher than that of normal cells. The
      Raman spectra of brain cancer Astrocytoma shows that the structural changes of
      cancer cells happen so that many biological functions of these cells are lost.
      The results indicate that Raman spectra can offer the experimental basis for the 
      cancer diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Stem cell-like glioma cells promote tumor angiogenesis through vascular
      endothelial growth factor.
PG  - 7843-8
AB  - Malignant gliomas are highly lethal cancers dependent on angiogenesis. Critical
      tumor subpopulations within gliomas share characteristics with neural stem cells.
      We examined the potential of stem cell-like glioma cells (SCLGC) to support tumor
      angiogenesis. SCLGC isolated from human glioblastoma biopsy specimens and
      xenografts potently generated tumors when implanted into the brains of
      immunocompromised mice, whereas non-SCLGC tumor cells isolated from only a few
      tumors formed secondary tumors when xenotransplanted. Tumors derived from SCLGC
      were morphologically distinguishable from non-SCLGC tumor populations by
      widespread tumor angiogenesis, necrosis, and hemorrhage. To determine a potential
      molecular mechanism for SCLGC in angiogenesis, we measured the expression of a
      panel of angiogenic factors secreted by SCLGC. In comparison with matched
      non-SCLGC populations, SCLGC consistently secreted markedly elevated levels of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were further induced by hypoxia.
      In an in vitro model of angiogenesis, SCLGC-conditioned medium significantly
      increased endothelial cell migration and tube formation compared with non-SCLGC
      tumor cell-conditioned medium. The proangiogenic effects of glioma SCLGC on
      endothelial cells were specifically abolished by the anti-VEGF neutralizing
      antibody bevacizumab, which is in clinical use for cancer therapy. Furthermore,
      bevacizumab displayed potent antiangiogenic efficacy in vivo and suppressed
      growth of xenografts derived from SCLGC but limited efficacy against xenografts
      derived from a matched non-SCLGC population. Together these data indicate that
      stem cell-like tumor cells can be a crucial source of key angiogenic factors in
      cancers and that targeting proangiogenic factors from stem cell-like tumor
      populations may be critical for patient therapy.

TI  - Intracranial epidermoid cyst and syringohydromyelia in a dog.
PG  - 339-44
AB  - A 5-year-old female Cocker Spaniel dog had a sudden onset of vestibular disease
      that localized to the caudal fossa. Upon computed tomography of the brain, a
      large, hypoattenuating mass with a slight peripheral ring enhancement pattern was
      detected ventral to the cerebellum. A hypoattenuating region was also identified 
      in the center of the C2 spinal cord segment, consistent with syringohydromyelia. 
      Postmortem examination of the brain revealed a fluid filled, cystic mass located 
      dorsal to medulla oblongata that caused severe compression of the overlying
      cerebellum. The histopathologic diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst. Extensive
      syringohydromyelia and obstructive hydrocephalus were identified, both thought to
      be secondary to overcrowding of the caudal fossa.

TI  - [A clinical study of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura].
PG  - 482-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study on the first Chinese congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic
      purpura (TTP) patient with respect to peripheral blood platelet count and
      ADAMTS13 activity, ADAMTS13 antigen, anti-endothelial cell antibody (ACEA), and
      thrombospondin1 (TSP1) etc. to compared it with idiopathic TTP and to explore
      something special and meaningful in the pathogenesis of congenital TTP. METHODS: 
      A total of 30 volunteers served as controls. The congenital TTP patient and 10
      carriers in her pedigree as well as 7 idiopathic TTP patients were included in
      this study. Residue collagen binding assay and a newly developed sandwich ELISA
      were used for determination of ADAMTS13 activity and antigen respectively. An
      ELISA for ACEA and a commercial kit for TSP1 were use in the study. RESULTS:
      After a "3-4 weeks regular relapse" of the congenital TTP, which is similar to
      that in other reports, the Chinese patient moved into a new relapse cycle. The
      average of the antigen levels of this patient before plasma exchange (PE) and at 
      the interval between relapses was (22.79 +/- 14.61) U/L (P < 0.01), while that of
      Chinese normal control (NC) turned out to be (600.93 +/- 145.36) U/L. TSP1
      detected at the same time (4.67 +/- 1.62) mg/L in the congenital TTP patient was 
      much lower than that in NC (18.34 +/- 7.24) mg/L (P < 0.01). A value in ACEA
      assay was 0.58 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.01) for congenital TTP, which was a little higher 
      than that in NC (0.40 +/- 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital TTP may have changeable 
      relapse cycles during episodes. ADAMTS13 antigen and TSP1 and ACEA in congenital 
      TTP showed significant difference as compared with those in NC. ADAMTS13 and ACEA
      in congenital TTP were also markedly lower than those in idiopathic TTP.

TI  - Patterns of platelet response in idiopathic TTP/HUS: frequency of declining
      platelet counts with plasma exchange and the recognition and significance of a
      pseudo refractory state.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - For thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), daily plasma exchange (TPE) is
      typically discontinued when the platelet count normalizes (>150 x 10(9)/L). We
      observed a decline in platelet count during TPE and in patients who appeared
      pseudo-refractory because of a platelet count plateau (100-150 10(9)/L range). In
      the present study, we evaluated platelet count trends in TTP patients.
      Retrospective review of TTP patients from 01/1999 to 12/2004 was completed.
      Patients were categorized based on platelet count trends: Group I, counts rose
      then decreased to levels <100 x 10(9)/L; Group II, counts declined following TPE 
      initiation; Group III, counts rose continuously; Group IV, counts decreased after
      the count was >100 x 10(9)/L. Additionally, we identified pseudo-refractory
      patients caused by a platelet count plateau (>100 x 10(9)/L but <150 x 10(9)/L). 
      We identified 60 TTP patients. Within Group I (17 patients/17 series/19.1% of
      total), the mean decrease in platelet count was 67.3% +/- 22.1% following initial
      rise. Within Group II (24 patients/25 series/28.1% of total), the mean decrease
      was 28% +/- 5.3% following presentation. Group III included 31 patients/39 series
      (43.8% of the total). Within Group IV (seven patients/eight series/9.0% of
      total), the mean decrease was 17.4% +/- 12.6% following a sustained rise >100 x
      10(9)/L. With a declining platelet count and daily TPE, it is generally
      sufficient to stay the course and the decline will reverse. Our limited
      experience with pseudo-refractory patients supports discontinuing TPE when counts
      plateau between 100 and 150 x 10(9)/L when a therapy goal is a platelet count of 
      150 x 10(9)/L. Recognition of this pseudo-refractory state can minimize the risks
      of prolonged TPE and the risks of adjunct interventions.

AB  - The histological classification of brain tumors currently is based on the
      morphological appearance and protein expression patterns that reflect specific
      cell types within the central nervous system. Recent studies have suggested that 
      the cells of origin for brain tumors may persist in the fully formed tumors, and 
      that these "cancer stem cells" might represent the relevant cellular targets for 
      anticancer therapy. In this regard, insights into the developmental neurobiology 
      of brain tumors has significant impact on our understanding of the molecular and 
      cellular pathogenesis of these devastating cancers, as well as the development of
      new strategies for treating brain tumors.

TI  - Multiple innate inflammatory responses induced after systemic adenovirus vector
      delivery depend on a functional complement system.
PG  - 588-98
AB  - Excessive complement activation can result in extreme tissue damage and systemic 
      inflammatory responses, similar to innate immune responses rapidly elicited after
      systemic adenovirus (Ad) injections. To determine if Ad interactions with the
      complement system impact upon Ad-induced innate immune responses, we injected Ad 
      into complement-deficient, C3-knockout mice (C3-KO) or wild-type mice (WT) and
      quantitatively compared multiple anti-Ad innate immune responses in both strains 
      of mice. In Ad-treated WT mice, we noted rapid increases in plasma KC levels (1 h
      post injection), followed by increases in IL-6, IFN-gamma, RANTES, IL-12(p40),
      IL-5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF and subsequently thrombocytopenia. Conversely, in
      Ad-treated C3-KO mice, many of these inflammatory responses were significantly
      blunted, including the avoidance of Ad-induced thrombocytopenia. Global liver
      transcriptome responses in Ad-treated WT mice were assessed by RT-PCR-validated
      gene array analysis and were found to be also significantly affected by the lack 
      of complement activity in Ad-treated C3-KO mice. Finally, our results confirmed
      the ability of high dose Ads to transduce hepatocytes despite a lack of
      complement activity. In summary, Ad interactions with the mammalian complement
      system are significant and likely initiate and/or exacerbate many of the
      inflammatory responses noted after systemic Ad injections.

TI  - OSU-03012 in the treatment of glioblastoma.
PG  - 437-9
AB  - In an article presented in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology, Yacoub et al.
      (p. 589) examine the actions of
      2-amino-N{4-5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl}-aceta
      mide (OSU-03012) on both primary and glioblastoma cell lines. The authors found
      that OSU-03012 could induce tumor cell death by itself but also acted as a strong
      sensitizing agent to radiotherapy-induced cell death. Glioblastoma cells were
      also more sensitive to this compound than nontransformed astrocytes.
      Radiation-induced cell death was refractory to small interfering RNA-directed
      inhibition of PDK1 but not OSU-03012. These results indicate that OSU-03012,
      which has been thought to primarily mediate antitumor effects via the inhibition 
      of PDK1, has actions independent of PDK1. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated
      that the effects of OSU-03012 were independent of ERB-B1-vIII and PTEN
      expression. These are important findings because they start to identify a new
      mechanism to sensitize glioblastoma cells and also suggest that OSU-03012 could
      be combined with existing inhibitors to further sensitize tumor cells. In
      glioblastoma cells, OSU-03012 seemed to induce apoptosis via endoplasmic
      reticulum stress-induced PERK-dependent signaling. OSU-03012-induced death of the
      glioblastoma was only weakly suppressed by the pan-caspase inhibitor,
      N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp, suggesting that OSU-03012-induced cell death was
      largely caspase-independent. Overall, these are exciting results and suggest that
      new more effective treatment options may be obtainable for people suffering from 
      these deadly tumors.

TI  - Sun protection strength of a hydroquinone 4%/retinol 0.3% preparation containing 
      sunscreens.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyschromias are common and significantly impact patients' quality of 
      life. Formulas containing hydroquinone 4% are effective in these conditions.
      Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can worsen disease and complicate
      treatment, the incorporation of sunscreens can avert this problem. METHODS: We
      tested the sun protection factor of a hydroquinone formulation (Lustra-Ultra,
      TaroPharma, Hawthorne, NY) containing avobenzone 3%, and octinoxate 7.5%
      according to the FDA Sunscreen Monograph on 20 volunteer subjects. We also
      determined the UVR absorbance spectrum of the preparation. RESULTS: The mean sun 
      protection factor (SPF) of 21.7 satisfied labeling requirements for SPF 20. The
      formulation exhibited strongest photoprotection near the wavelengths of peak sun 
      burning effectiveness in the UVB region and maintains significant UVR absorbance 
      through the entire UVA region. CONCLUSIONS: Avobenzone 3% and octinoxate 7.5%
      provide broad spectrum UV protection. Incorporating these sunscreens into a
      hydroquinone preparation simplifies the treatment regimen while providing
      significant photoprotection for patients being treated for dyschromia.

TI  - Recurrent syncope and anaphylaxis as presentation of systemic mastocytosis in a
      pediatric patient: case report and literature review.
PG  - S210-3
AB  - Mastocytosis refers to a rare collection of disorders, both cutaneous and
      systemic, that are characterized by increased numbers of mast cells. Depending on
      the extent of the disease, these disorders may present with symptoms resulting
      from mast cell degranulation including flushing, diarrhea, vomiting, cramping,
      syncope, or anaphylaxis. In pediatric patients, cutaneous involvement is most
      prevalent in the form of urticaria pigmentosa, which is typically asymptomatic or
      minimally so with resolution by adolescence. In this case report and review of
      literature, we review a case of a 3-year-old child with uritcaria pigmentosa
      displaying recurrent syncope and anaphylaxis as the first presentation of
      systemic mastocytosis. We found data to be limited on this topic, and concluded
      that pediatric patients with prior diagnoses of cutaneous mastocytosis could
      benefit from either more aggressive screening for systemic disease or
      prophylactic treatment with antihistamines and rescue subcutaneous epinephrine.

TI  - Aberrant splicing in the ocular albinism type 1 gene (OA1/GPR143) is corrected in
      vitro by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides.
PG  - 420-6
AB  - An intronic point mutation was identified in the ocular albinism type 1 (OA1)
      gene (HUGO symbol, GPR143) in a family with the X-linked form of ocular albinism.
      Interestingly, the mutation creates a new acceptor splice site in intron 7 of the
      OA1 gene. In addition to low levels of normally spliced mRNA product of the OA1
      gene, the patient samples contained also an aberrantly spliced mRNA with a 165 bp
      fragment of intron 7 (from position +750 to +914) inserted between exons 7 and 8.
      The abnormal transcript contained a premature stop codon and was unstable, as
      revealed by Northern blot analysis. We defined that mutation
      NC_000023.8:g.25288G>A generated a consensus binding motif for the splicing
      factor enhancer ASF/SF2, which most likely favored transcription of the aberrant 
      mRNA. Furthermore, it activated a cryptic donor-splice site causing the inclusion
      between exons 7 and 8 of the 165 bp intronic fragment. Thus, the aberrant
      splicing is most likely explained by the generation of a de novo splicing
      enhancer motif. Finally, to rescue OA1 expression in the patient's melanocytes,
      we designed an antisense morpholino modified oligonucleotide complementary to the
      mutant sequence. The morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) was able to rescue OA1
      expression and restore the OA1 protein level in the patient's melanocytes through
      skipping of the aberrant inclusion. The use of MO demonstrated that the lack of
      OA1 was caused by the generation of a new splice site. Furthermore, this
      technique will lead to new approaches to correct splice site mutations that cause
      human diseases.

TI  - Cognitive correlates of a functional COMT polymorphism in children with 22q11.2
      deletion syndrome.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a common microdeletion syndrome
      associated with a markedly elevated risk of schizophrenia in adulthood. Cognitive
      impairments such as a low IQ and deficits in attention and executive function are
      common in childhood. The catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene maps within the
      deleted region and is involved in the degradation of dopamine, a neurotransmitter
      thought to be important in cognition and the development of schizophrenia. Thus, 
      we examined the correlation between neurocognitive deficits and a common
      polymorphism Val(158)Met in the COMT gene in a cohort of children with 22q11DS.
      Our results show that children with 22q11DS who have the Met allele have higher
      IQ and achievement scores and perform better on measures of prefrontal cognition,
      such as the Continuous Performance Task, as compared with those with the Val
      allele. These results confirm that the hemizygous COMT Val(158)Met genotype
      impacts upon cognition in children with 22q11DS.

AB  - Malignant gliomas, including the most common subtype, glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM), are among the most devastating of neoplasms. Their aggressive infiltration
      in the CNS typically produces progressive and profound disability--ultimately
      leading to death in nearly all cases. Improvement in outcome has been elusive
      despite decades of intensive clinical and laboratory research. Surgery and
      radiotherapy, the traditional cornerstones of therapy, provide palliative
      benefit, while the value of chemotherapy has been marginal and controversial.
      Limited delivery and tumor heterogeneity are two fundamental factors that have
      critically hindered therapeutic progress. A novel chemoradiotherapy approach,
      consisting of temozolomide administered concurrently during radiotherapy followed
      by adjuvant systemic temozolomide, has recently demonstrated a meaningful, albeit
      modest, improvement in overall survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients. As
      cell-signaling alterations linked to the development and progression of gliomas
      are being increasingly elucidated, targeted therapies have rapidly entered
      preclinical and clinical evaluation. Responses to therapies that function via DNA
      damage have been associated with specific mediators of resistance that may also
      be subject to targeted therapies. Other approaches include novel locoregional
      delivery techniques to overcome barriers of delivery. The simultaneous
      development of multiple advanced therapies based on specific tumor biology may
      finally offer glioma patients improved survival.

TI  - Salvage radioimmunotherapy with murine iodine-131-labeled antitenascin monoclonal
      antibody 81C6 for patients with recurrent primary and metastatic malignant brain 
      tumors: phase II study results.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of intraresection cavity
      iodine-131-labeled murine antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (131I-m81C6)
      among recurrent malignant brain tumor patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this
      phase II trial, 100 mCi of 131I-m81C6 was injected directly into the surgically
      created resection cavity (SCRC) of 43 patients with recurrent malignant glioma
      (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM], n = 33; anaplastic astrocytoma [AA], n = 6;
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma [AO], n = 2; gliosarcoma [GS], n = 1; and metastatic
      adenocarcinoma, n = 1) followed by chemotherapy. RESULTS: With a median follow-up
      of 172 weeks, 63% and 59% of patients with GBM/GS and AA/AO tumors were alive at 
      1 year. Median overall survival for patients with GBM/GS and AA/AO tumors was 64 
      and 99 weeks, respectively. Ten patients (23%) developed acute hematologic
      toxicity. Five patients (12%) developed acute reversible neurotoxicity. One
      patient (2%) developed irreversible neurotoxicity. No patients required
      reoperation for radionecrosis. CONCLUSION: In this single-institution phase II
      study, administration of 100 mCi of 131I-m81C6 to recurrent malignant glioma
      patients followed by chemotherapy is associated with a median survival that is
      greater than that of historical controls treated with surgery plus iodine-125
      brachytherapy. Furthermore, toxicity was acceptable. Administration of a fixed
      millicurie dose resulted in a wide range of absorbed radiation doses to the SCRC.
      We are now conducting a phase II trial, approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration, using patient-specific 131I-m81C6 dosing, to deliver 44 Gy to the
      SCRC followed by standardized chemotherapy. A phase III multicenter trial with
      patient-specific dosing is planned.

TI  - Clinicopathologic findings in dogs seroreactive to Bartonella henselae antigens.
PG  - 2060-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential clinical relevance of seroreactivity to
      Bartonella henselae antigens in dogs. ANIMALS: 40 dogs seroreactive to B henselae
      and 45 dogs that did not seroreact to B henselae. PROCEDURE: A case-control study
      was conducted. Clinical and clinicopathologic findings were extracted from
      medical records of each dog. RESULTS: Statistical differences were not detected
      between dogs seroreactive or nonseroreactive to B henselae when analyzed on the
      basis of disease category or results of hematologic, biochemical, urine, or
      cytologic analysis. However, seroreactivity to B henselae antigens was detected
      in 2 of 4 dogs with a clinical diagnosis of granulomatous meningoencephalitis, 3 
      of 4 dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, 3 of 4 dogs with infective
      endocarditis, 2 of 3 dogs with lymphoid neoplasia, and 5 of 10 dogs with
      polyarthritis. Additionally, seroreactivity to B henselae antigens was detected
      in 18 of 34 thrombocytopenic dogs and 14 of 27 dogs with neutrophilia.
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Significant associations were not detected
      between seroreactivity to B henselae and various diseases. Prospective
      epidemiologic studies investigating specific diseases, such as
      meningoencephalitis or polyarthritis, and specific hematologic abnormalities,
      such as immunemediated hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, should be conducted 
      to further define the potential clinical relevance of antibodies against B
      henselae in dogs. IMPACT FOR HUMAN MEDICINE: Bartonella organisms are
      increasingly reported as pathogens that induce are increasingly reported as
      pathogens that induce chronic infections in humans and dogs. Dogs may serve as
      natural candidates for future study of the disease in humans.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for lateralizing nodular
      hyperplasia.
PG  - 1009-16; discussion 1016-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nodular adrenal hyperplasia (NAH) may mimic the biochemical
      characteristics of an aldosterone-producing adenoma. The authors evaluated the
      outcomes of unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the setting of lateralizing 
      aldosterone hypersecretion by NAH. METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive
      patients who underwent a laparoscopic adrenalectomy for primary
      hyperaldosteronism owing to NAH was performed. Patient demographics,
      perioperative symptoms, medications, radiographic findings, and serum chemistries
      were analyzed. Response to operation was classified according to postoperative
      control of hypertension and hypokalemia as resolved, improved, or refractory.
      RESULTS: From January 1999 to October 2004, 15 patients underwent a laparoscopic 
      unilateral adrenalectomy for hyperaldosteronism owing to lateralizing NAH. Nine
      (60%) patients presented with > or =5 years of hypertension, including 8 (53%)
      patients with labile or malignant hypertension. Ten (67%) patients had
      hypokalemia. Abdominal imaging results were normal in 9 (60%) patients. All
      patients underwent adrenal venous sampling (94% successfully), which revealed an 
      average adjusted aldosterone ratio of 17.6 (range, 1.2 to 75.9). At a mean
      follow-up of 26 (range, 4 to 58) months, hypertension had resolved in 4 (27%),
      improved in 8 (53%), and was refractory in 3 (20%) patients. Hypokalemia resolved
      in all patients. There were no complications, conversions, or mortalities.
      CONCLUSION: This series shows that unilateral adrenalectomy for lateralizing NAH 
      results in eradication of hypokalemia and resolution or significant improvement
      in hypertension in 80% of patients at long-term follow-up. When lateralization of
      aldosterone production is noted, laparoscopic adrenalectomy provides significant 
      clinical improvement even in patients with a pathologic diagnosis of NAH.

TI  - Gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors: the wave of the future
      in cancer therapy.
PG  - 481-6
AB  - Targeted therapies are one of the latest innovative trends in cancer therapy. The
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a target found in high concentrations 
      in several solid tumors including lung, breast, colorectal, and brain. Tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839), block the EGFR. As a
      result, there is inhibition of cellular proliferation, promotion of apoptosis,
      and inhibition of anti-angiogenesis. Gefitinib has demonstrated significant
      efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), leading to FDA approval for
      treatment of this refractory disease. Phase 2 trials with gefitinib for platinum 
      refractory NSCLC reported disease response and symptom improvement. Early results
      of phase 2 studies of gefitinib, combined with standard chemotherapy in
      colorectal cancer, showed a 75% response rate compared with 55% with standard
      therapy alone. Gefitinib, combined with flutamide, produced an additive growth
      inhibition in prostate cancer. A phase 2 trial of gefitinib in first-relapse
      glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated median overall survival from treatment start
      of 39.4 weeks compared with 40 weeks with standard chemotherapy. Gefitinib is an 
      oral agent with a mild toxicity profile, and thus, may be an optimal addition to 
      chemotherapeutic regimens for some solid tumors. Gefitinib is potentially a vital
      and useful weapon in the arsenal of cancer therapies.

TI  - Endoscope-assisted removal of colloid cysts of the third ventricle.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - Colloid cysts are benign space-occupying lesions, which arise from the velum
      interpositum or the choroid plexus of the third ventricle and are able to produce
      symptomatic obstruction of the foramina of Monro with resultant hydrocephalus. In
      our department, we have operated on colloid cysts routinely in an
      endoscope-assisted microsurgical manner via a key-hole approach. During a period 
      of 10 years, 28 microsurgical resections of colloid cysts of the third ventricle 
      were performed. Seven patients demonstrated colloid cysts inside the third
      ventricle with obstruction of the right foramen Monro, two patients demonstrated 
      cysts with obstruction of the left foramen Monro. Twelve patients suffered from
      cysts inside the third ventricle with obstruction of both foramina Monro and five
      patients demonstrated cysts lying into the third ventricle without obstruction of
      the foramina. In 21 patients no preoperative therapy was performed outside. Three
      patients had received shunt systems before in other hospitals, two patients
      received aspiration of the cysts under stereotactic conditions and two patients
      received external ventricular drains. Total removal of the cyst was achieved in
      all patients (100%). No patient received a second operation, because none had a
      recurrent cyst. All cysts were removed with the cyst wall. Overall clinical
      improvement was achieved in a long-standing period between 6 and 83 months in 27 
      (96%) patients. In one patient (4%) the psychomotor disturbance was unchanged and
      no patient deteriorated. From the microsurgical point of view, the combination of
      keyhole surgery under endoscopic visual control using preexisting anatomical
      windows offers an effective minimally invasive approach.

TI  - Geographic distribution of babesiosis among dogs in the United States and
      association with dog bites: 150 cases (2000-2003).
PG  - 942-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the geographic distribution of babesiosis among dogs in
      the United States and determine, for dogs other than American Pit Bull Terriers
      (APBTs), whether infection was associated with a recent dog bite. DESIGN:
      Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 150 dogs. PROCEDURE: Canine blood samples submitted
      to the North Carolina State University Vector-Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory
      between May 2000 and October 2003 for which results of a Babesia-specific
      polymerase chain reaction assay were positive were identified, and breed and
      geographic origin of dogs from which samples were obtained were recorded. History
      and hematologic abnormalities for dogs that were not APBTs were recorded, and
      possible associations with a recent dog bite were examined. RESULTS: Dogs
      positive for Babesia DNA were located in 29 states and 1 Canadian province
      (Ontario). Babesia gibsoni was the most commonly detected species, with B gibsoni
      DNA detected in blood samples from 131 of 144 (91%) dogs. Of the 131 dogs
      positive for B gibsoni DNA, 122 (93%) were APBTs. Of the 10 dogs positive for
      Babesia canis vogeli DNA, 6 were Greyhounds. In dogs other than APBTs, there was 
      an association between having recently been bitten by another dog, particularly
      an APBT, and infection with B gibsoni. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
      Results document an expansion of the known geographic range for babesiosis among 
      dogs in the United States. Testing for babesiosis should be pursued in dogs with 
      clinicopathologic abnormalities consistent with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia 
      or thrombocytopenia, particularly if there is a history of a recent dog bite.

TI  - Experimental Ehrlichia canis infection in the dog does not cause
      immunosuppression.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - A carrier state develops in some Ehrlichia canis-infected dogs due to ineffective
      host defenses. The subsequent development of immune-mediated diseases or
      opportunistic infections in chronic ehrlichiosis suggests dysregulation of
      immunity; however, the immunobiology of this infection has not been well
      characterized. In this study, eight dogs were infected with E. canis, and changes
      in seroreactivity, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations, peripheral blood T
      cell subsets, lymphocyte blastogenesis (LBT), and lymphokine-activated killer
      (LAK) activity were evaluated over 4 months. Infection, which was documented by
      seroconversion, polymerase chain reaction, and blood culture, caused
      self-limiting fever and thrombocytopenia. Infected dogs developed an anti-E.
      canis antibody response but were not immune to re-infection. Serum IgM, IgG, and 
      IgA concentrations were unaffected by E. canis. The percentage of circulating
      CD4(+) T cells was similar in uninfected and infected dogs at all points.
      Infected dogs developed a CD8(+) lymphocytosis 6 weeks after inoculation that
      subsequently subsided, despite organism persistence. Functional defects of
      cell-mediated immunity, measured as suppression of LAK activity or mitogen-driven
      LBT, were not observed. These results suggest that immune responses are not
      grossly impaired in young dogs during the first several months following
      experimental E. canis infection.

TI  - Cell death pathways in juvenile Batten disease.
PG  - 973-85
AB  - UNLABELLED: Apoptosis, Golgi fragmentation and elevated ceramide levels occur in 
      Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (JNCL) neurons, lymphoblasts and
      fibroblasts. Our purpose was to examine whether apoptosis is the mechanism of
      cell death in JNCL. This was tested by analyzing caspase-dependent/independent
      pathways and autophagy, and caspase effects on ceramide and Golgi fragmentation. 
      zVAD prevented caspase activation, but not all cell death. Inhibiting caspase-8
      suppressed caspases more than inhibition of any other caspase. Inhibiting
      caspase-8/6 was synergistic. zVAD suppressed autophagy. 3-methyladenine
      suppressed caspase activation less than zVAD did. Blocking
      autophagy/caspase-8/or-6 was synergistic. Blocking autophagy/caspase-3/or-9 was
      not. Inhibiting caspase-9/3 suppressed autophagy. Golgi fragmentation was
      suppressed by zVAD, and blocked by CLN3. CLN3, not zVAD, prevented ceramide
      elevation. IN CONCLUSION: caspase-dependent/independent apoptosis and autophagy
      occur caspase-dependent pathways initiate autophagy Golgi fragmentation results
      from apoptosis ceramide elevation is independent of caspases, and CLN3 blocks all
      cell death, prevents Golgi fragmentation and elevation of ceramide in JNCL.

TI  - Hyperkalemia: a review.
PG  - 272-90
AB  - Potassium is the principal intracellular cation, and maintenance of the
      distribution of potassium between the intracellular and the extracellular
      compartments relies on several homeostatic mechanisms. When these mechanisms are 
      perturbed, hypokalemia or hyperkalemia may occur. This review covers
      hyperkalemia, that is, a serum potassium concentration exceeding 5 mmol/L. The
      review includes a discussion of potassium homeostasis and the etiologies of
      hyperkalemia and focuses on the prompt recognition and treatment of hyperkalemia.
      This disorder should be of major concern to clinicians because of its propensity 
      to cause fatal arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia is easily diagnosed, and rapid and
      effective treatments are readily available. Unfortunately, treatment of this
      life-threatening condition is often delayed or insufficiently attentive or
      aggressive.

TI  - Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes of primary tumors in the
      canine central nervous system.
PG  - 550-8
AB  - The pathophysiologic similarities of many human and canine cancers support the
      role of the domestic dog as a model for brain tumor research. Here we report the 
      construction of a custom canine brain-specific cDNA microarray and the analysis
      of gene expression patterns of several different types of canine brain tumor. The
      microarray contained 4000 clones from a canine brain specific cDNA library
      including 2161 clones that matched known genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 
      and 25 cancer-related genes. Our study included 16 brain tumors (seven
      meningiomas, five glial tumors, two ependymomas, and two choroid plexus
      papillomas) from a variety of different dog breeds. We identified several genes
      previously found to be differentially expressed in human brain tumors. This
      suggests that human and canine brain tumors share a common pathogenesis. In
      addition, we also found differentially expressed genes unique to either
      meningiomas or the glial tumors. This report represents the first global gene
      expression analysis of different types of canine brain tumors by cDNA microarrays
      and might aid in the identification of potential candidate genes involved in
      tumor formation and progression.

TI  - Mechanisms of failure after endoscopic third ventriculostomy in young infants.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - OBJECT: The cause of failed endoscopic third vetriculostomy (ETV) surgery in the 
      treatment of hydrocephalus may be a poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      or a new or continuing obstruction of CSF pathways. Particularly in infants, ETV 
      failures often are ascribed to a still poorly developed CSF absorptive capacity. 
      METHODS: The authors report on a series of 11 infants younger than 1 year of age 
      undergoing at least one repeated endoscopic surgery after a failed initial ETV
      for aqueductal stenosis. The following three patterns of endoscopic findings were
      observed: 1) reclosure of the ventriculostoma; 2) narrowing of the
      ventriculostoma; and 3) patent ventriculostoma with new arachnoid membranes in
      the basal cisterns below the floor of the third ventricle, not present at the
      time of the first ETV. In all patients, a new obstruction of CSF pathways was
      seen during repeated ETV or shunt surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data
      strongly suggest that CSF pathway reclosure is the factor most responsible for
      ETV failure in obstructive hydrocephalus. According to both their experiences and
      to studies published in the literature, the formation of new arachnoid membranes 
      or scars plays a far greater role in ETV failure than does poor CSF absorption,
      at least in aqueductal stenosis. It is hypothesized that infants have a higher
      tendency to form new arachnoid membranes than do older patients and that this
      factor may explain (at least in part) the higher ETV failure rate in patients
      younger than 1 year old.

TI  - Clinical and pathologic features of familial interstitial pneumonia.
PG  - 1146-52
AB  - RATIONALE: Several lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors and
      environmental exposures play a role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis.
      OBJECTIVES: We evaluated families with 2 or more cases of idiopathic interstitial
      pneumonia among first-degree family members (familial interstitial pneumonia, or 
      FIP), and identified 111 families with FIP having 309 affected and 360 unaffected
      individuals. METHODS: The presence of probable or definite FIP was based on
      medical record review in 28 cases (9.1%); clinical history, diffusing capacity of
      carbon monoxide (DL(CO)), and chest X-ray in 16 cases (5.2%); clinical history,
      DL(CO), and high-resolution computed tomography chest scan in 191 cases (61.8%); 
      clinical history and surgical lung biopsy in 56 cases (18.1%); and clinical
      history and autopsy in 18 cases (5.8%). RESULTS: Older age (68.3 vs. 53.1; p <
      0.0001), male sex (55.7 vs. 37.2%; p < 0.0001), and having ever smoked cigarettes
      (67.3 vs. 34.1%; p < 0.0001) were associated with the development of FIP. After
      controlling for age and sex, having ever smoked cigarettes remained strongly
      associated with the development of FIP (odds ratio(adj), 3.6; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.3-9.8). Evidence of aggregation of disease was highly significant (p 
      < 0.001) among sibling pairs, and 20 pedigrees demonstrated vertical
      transmission, consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Forty-five percent 
      of pedigrees demonstrated phenotypic heterogeneity, with some pedigrees
      demonstrating several subtypes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia occurring
      within the same families. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FIP may be
      caused by an interaction between a specific environmental exposure and a gene (or
      genes) that predisposes to the development of several subtypes of idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonia.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of PLC-eta2.
PG  - 667-76
AB  - PLC (phospholipase C) isoenzymes catalyse the conversion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 into
      the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and the protein kinase
      C-activating second messenger, diacylglycerol. With the goal of identifying
      additional mammalian PLC isoenzymes, we screened the NCBI non-redundant database 
      using a BLAST algorithm for novel sequences with homology with the conserved PLC 
      catalytic core. Two unique sequences corresponding to two unknown PLC isoenzymes 
      were identified, and one of these, designated PLC-eta2, was cloned and
      characterized. Most of the coding sequence of PLC-eta2 was constructed from two
      ESTs (expressed sequence tags), which included an overlapping sequence that was
      confirmed by multiple ESTs and mRNAs. 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) 
      also identified an upstream exon not deduced from available EST or mRNA
      sequences. Sequence analysis of PLC-eta2 revealed the canonical domains of a PLC 
      isoenzyme with an additional long C-terminus that contains a class II PDZ-binding
      motif. Genomic analyses indicated that PLC-eta2 is encoded by 23 exons. RT-PCR
      (reverse transcriptase-PCR) analyses illustrated expression of PLC-eta2 in human 
      retina and kidney, as well as in mouse brain, eye and lung. RT-PCR with
      exon-specific primers also revealed tissue-specific expression of four splice
      variants in mouse that represent alternative use of sequences in exons 21, 22 and
      23. PLC-eta2-specific antisera recognized one of these splice variants as an
      approx. 155 kDa species when expressed in COS-7 cells; PLC-eta2 natively
      expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells also migrated as an approx. 155 kDa
      species. PLC activity was observed in vitro and in vivo for three different
      constructs of PLC-eta2, each containing possible alternatively spliced first
      exons. Co-expression of PLC-eta2 with Gbeta1gamma2 dimers of heterotrimeric
      G-proteins resulted in marked stimulation of inositol lipid hydrolysis. Thus
      PLC-eta2 may in part function downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors.

TI  - Simvastatin reduces vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: results
      of a pilot randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 2024-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral vasospasm remains a major source of morbidity
      after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We demonstrate that simvastatin
      reduces serum markers of brain injury and attenuates vasospasm after SAH.
      METHODS: Patients with angiographically documented aneurysmal SAH were randomized
      within 48 hours of symptom onset to receive either simvastatin (80 mg daily;
      n=19) or placebo (n=20) for 14 days. Plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
      aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase were recorded weekly to evaluate
      laboratory evidence of hepatitis or myositis. Serum markers of brain injury were 
      recorded daily. The primary end point of vasospasm was defined as clinical
      impression (delayed ischemic deficit not associated with rebleed, infection, or
      hydrocephalus) in the presence of > or =1 confirmatory radiographic test
      (angiography or transcranial Doppler demonstrating mean V(MCA) >160 m/sec).
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences in laboratory-defined
      transaminitis or myositis between groups. No patients developed clinical symptoms
      of myopathy or hepatitis. Plasma von Willebrand factor and S100beta were
      decreased 3 to 10 days after SAH (P<0.05) in patients receiving simvastatin
      versus placebo. Highest mean middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler
      velocities were significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated group (103+/-41
      versus 149+/-47; P<0.01). In addition, vasospasm was significantly reduced
      (P<0.05) in the simvastatin-treated group (5 of 19) compared with those who
      received placebo (12 of 20). CONCLUSIONS: The use of simvastatin as prophylaxis
      against delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH is a safe and
      well-tolerated intervention. Its use attenuates serum markers associated with
      brain injury and decreases the incidence of radiographic vasospasm and delayed
      ischemic deficit.

TI  - Novel approach to the treatment of hyperpigmented photodamaged skin: 4%
      hydroquinone/0.3% retinol versus tretinoin 0.05% emollient cream.
PG  - 799-804
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild to moderately photodamaged skin is characterized by
      dyspigmentation, fine wrinkles, and tactile roughness. An optimal approach to the
      topical treatment of photoaging would simultaneously address all appearance
      issues. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of 4%
      hydroquinone and 0.3% retinol in photoaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 16-week
      study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of a single cream
      containing prescription topical 4% hydroquinone for dyspigmentation and the
      cosmeceutical 0.3% retinol for fine wrinkles in an emollient vehicle for tactile 
      roughness. This novel formulation was compared with 0.05% tretinoin emollient
      cream, the standard against which all other topical photoaging treatments are
      compared. Investigator assessments, subject assessments, and photography
      represented the evaluation end points. RESULTS: The cosmeceutical emollient 4%
      hydroquinone/0.3% retinol cream more effectively diminished the collective signs 
      of photodamage than 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream in terms of dyspigmentation, 
      fine wrinkles, and tactile roughness in 16 weeks. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy
      of hydroquinone and retinol may improve photoaging-associated hyperpigmentation.

TI  - Physiological levels of PTEN control the size of the cellular Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) 
      pool.
PG  - 488-98
AB  - To understand how a signaling molecule's activities are regulated, we need
      insight into the processes controlling the dynamic balance between its synthesis 
      and degradation. For the Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 signal, this information is woefully
      inadequate. For example, the only known cytosolic enzyme with the capacity to
      degrade Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is the tumour-suppressor PTEN [J.J. Caffrey, T. Darden, 
      M.R. Wenk, S.B. Shears, FEBS Lett. 499 (2001) 6 ], but the biological relevance
      has been questioned by others [E.A. Orchiston, D. Bennett, N.R. Leslie, R.G.
      Clarke, L. Winward, C.P. Downes, S.T. Safrany, J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004) 1116 ]. 
      The current study emphasizes the role of physiological levels of PTEN in
      Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 homeostasis. We employed two cell models. First, we used a human
      U87MG glioblastoma PTEN-null cell line that hosts an ecdysone-inducible PTEN
      expression system. Second, the human H1299 bronchial cell line, in which PTEN is 
      hypomorphic due to promoter methylation, has been stably transfected with
      physiologically relevant levels of PTEN. In both models, a novel consequence of
      PTEN expression was to increase Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 pool size by 30-40% (p<0.01);
      this response was wortmannin-insensitive and, therefore, independent of the
      PtdIns 3-kinase pathway. In U87MG cells, induction of the G129R catalytically
      inactive PTEN mutant did not affect Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) levels. PTEN induction did
      not alter the expression of enzymes participating in Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 synthesis. 
      Another effect of PTEN expression in U87MG cells was to decrease InsP6 levels by 
      13% (p<0.02). The InsP6-phosphatase, MIPP, may be responsible for the latter
      effect; we show that recombinant human MIPP dephosphorylates InsP6 to
      D/L-Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5, levels of which increased 60% (p<0.05) following PTEN
      expression in U87MG cells. Overall, our data add higher inositol phosphates to
      the list of important cellular regulators [Y. Huang, R.P. Wernyj, D.D. Norton, P.
      Precht, M.C. Seminario, R.L. Wange, Oncogene, 24 (2005) 3819 ] the levels of
      which are modulated by expression of the highly pleiotropic PTEN protein.

TI  - Resolution of medullary nephrocalcinosis in children with metabolic bone
      disorders.
PG  - 1143-5
AB  - Ultrasonographic resolution of nephrocalcinosis (NC) has been reported in
      children with furosemide-induced NC, but not in other entities. We report the
      cases of four children with metabolic bone disease, two with hypophosphatasia and
      two with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, in whom we observed resolution of
      renal calcifications. At the time of ultrasonographic resolution of NC, 3 of the 
      patients were on anticalciuric diuretics, and all 4 had normal urinalysis, serum 
      creatinine and electrolyte profiles, as well as estimated creatinine clearance.
      In 3 of the children, evidence of mild tubular dysfunction was found. It thus
      seems that in some children with bone and mineral disorders who develop NC,
      ultrasonographic resolution of the renal calcifications can be seen; however,
      mild tubular dysfunction may remain and require follow-up. Further studies are
      suggested to explore the possible role of anticalciuric diuretics in promoting
      the resolution of NC.

TI  - Overproduction of DNA polymerase eta does not raise the spontaneous mutation rate
      in diploid human fibroblasts.
PG  - 714-24
AB  - Telomerase-immortalized lines of diploid xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V)
      fibroblasts (XP115LO and XP4BE) were complemented for constitutive or regulated
      expression of wild-type human DNA polymerase eta (hpol eta). The ectopic gene was
      expressed from a retroviral LTR at a population average of 34- to 59-fold above
      the endogenous (mutated) mRNA and high levels of hpol eta were detected by
      immunoblotting. The POLH cDNA was also cloned downstream from an
      ecdysone-regulated promoter and transduced into the same recipient cells.
      Abundance of the wild-type mRNA increased approximately 10-fold by addition of
      ponasterone to the culture medium. Complemented cell lines acquired normal
      resistance to the cytotoxic effects of UVC, even in the presence of 1mM caffeine.
      They also tolerated higher levels of UVC-induced template lesions during nascent 
      DNA elongation when compared to normal fibroblasts (NHF). UVC-induced mutation
      frequencies at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus
      were measured in the XP115LO+XPV cell line overproducing hpol eta constitutively 
      (E. Bassett, N.M. King, M.F. Bryant, S. Hector, L. Pendyala, S.G. Chaney, M.
      Cordeiro-Stone, The role of DNA polymerase eta in translesion synthesis past
      platinum-DNA adducts in human fibroblasts, Cancer Res. 64 (2004) 6469-6475).
      Induced mutation frequencies were significantly reduced, even below those
      observed in NHF; however, the average mutation frequency in untreated cultures
      was about three-fold higher than in the isogenic vector-control cell line. In
      this study, spontaneous HPRT mutation frequencies were measured at regular
      intervals, as isogenic fibroblasts either lacking or overproducing hpol eta were 
      expanded for 100 population doublings. The mutation rates estimated from these
      results were not significantly increased in XP115LO cells expressing abnormal
      levels of hpol eta, relative to the cells lacking this specialized polymerase.
      These findings suggest that diploid human fibroblasts with normal DNA repair
      capacities and intact checkpoints are well protected against the potential
      mutagenic outcome of overproducing hpol eta, while still benefiting from accurate
      translesion synthesis of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers.

TI  - Upward transtentorial herniation, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar edema in
      hypertensive encephalopathy.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edema of the cerebellum with secondary obstructive hydrocephalus is a
      rare presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy. The authors report an unusual
      case of isolated posterior fossa swelling with upward transtentorial herniation
      and hydrocephalus causing neurologic deterioration. These patients are often
      initially evaluated by a neurologist because of the acute neurologic symptoms.
      Prompt diagnosis with aggressive blood pressure control may obviate the need for 
      emergent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. REVIEW SUMMARY: This is a case
      report of a 26-year-old man who presented to the emergency room with confusion
      and somnolence over a 2-day period. His initial blood pressure was 175/110 mmHg. 
      On examination he was disoriented, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 points, 
      opening his eyes only to loud verbal stimuli, verbalizing inappropriately, and he
      was only able to follow simple commands. Neuroimaging revealed edema of the
      cerebellar folia with noncommunicating hydrocephalus and upward transtentorial
      herniation. Differential diagnoses of posterior fossa tumor, rhombencephalitis,
      and hypertensive encephalopathy were entertained. A thorough literature review is
      included with the discussion of this case. The patient underwent emergent
      ventriculostomy for CSF drainage and prompt blood pressure control with
      nitroprusside. After 48 hours of CSF drainage and correction of his hypertension,
      his neurologic examination normalized. Repeat imaging revealed near resolution of
      the obstructive hydrocephalus and cerebellar edema. CONCLUSION: Isolated edema of
      the cerebellum with upward transtentorial herniation and obstructive
      hydrocephalus is a rare presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy and should be
      considered in patients with an acute hypertensive crisis and mental status
      changes. This entity responds to prompt blood pressure control; however, emergent
      ventriculostomy by a neurosurgical team should be entertained for neurologic
      deterioration secondary to significant obstructive hydrocephalus, as illustrated 
      in this case.

TI  - PF4/heparin complexes are T cell-dependent antigens.
PG  - 929-31
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening, thrombotic disorder
      associated with development of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4)/heparin
      autoantibodies. Little is known about the antigenic and cellular requirements
      that initiate the immune response to these complexes. To begin to delineate
      mechanisms of autoantibody formation in HIT, we studied the immunizing effects of
      murine PF4 (mPF4)/heparin in mice with and without thymic function. Euthymic mice
      were injected with mPF4/heparin complexes, mPF4, heparin, or buffer. Mice
      injected with mPF4/heparin, but not mPF4 or heparin alone, developed
      heparin-dependent autoantibodies that shared serologic and functional
      characteristics of human HIT antibodies, including preferential binding to
      mPF4/heparin complexes and causing heparin- and FcRgammaIIA-dependent platelet
      activation. In contrast, athymic mice did not develop HIT-like antibodies. Taken 
      together, these studies establish that PF4/heparin complexes are highly
      immunogenic and elicit self-reacting anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in a T
      cell-dependent manner.

TI  - Corrective cosmetics are effective for women with facial pigmentary disorders.
PG  - 181-7
AB  - Visible facial lesions are a common and burdensome skin problem. This study
      examines the impact of corrective cosmetics in women with severe facial
      pigmentary disorders. Enrollment consisted of 73 women with one or more of the
      following conditions: acne, dermatosis papulosis, hypopigmentation, lentigines,
      melasma, rosacea, vascular proliferations, or other facial scars. The corrective 
      cosmetic (Dermablend) was applied at the initial visit, at which time
      instructions and a supply of product were provided. Assessments were conducted at
      baseline, 2-week, 4-week, and 3-month follow-up visits on 63 patients using the
      Skindex-16. The corrective cosmetic was well tolerated. There was improvement in 
      Skindex-16 scores after application of the corrective cosmetic, which continued
      at each follow-up visit and after adjustment for baseline confounders using
      multiple regression analyses. At 3 months, there was a 30% improvement in
      Skindex-16 score (P < .001). The corrective cosmetic was well tolerated and
      represents a valuable option that dermatologists can offer to patients with these
      conditions.

TI  - Epidemiology of obesity in the United States.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The challenges of the epidemic are not limited to concerns about bulk and weight.
      The disabilities caused by obesity are physiologic and psychosocial. The
      increased waist to hip girth is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular 
      disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Obesity also has been
      related directly to increased risk of sleep apnea, cancer, gallbladder disease,
      musculoskeletal disorders, severe pancreatitis, bacterial panniculitis,
      diverticulitis, infertility, urinary incontinence, and idiopathic intracranial
      hypertension. The psychosocial factors and quality of life in the obese
      population also have been documented. Although there is some debate, the obese
      have been found to be twice as likely to suffer from anxiety, impaired social
      interaction,and depression when compared with the nonobese population. Although
      advances in obesity surgery have resulted in long-term, lasting treatment of this
      disease and some of its comorbidities (ie, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea), 
      There is a pressing need to develop a comprehensive medical and nutrition plan to
      reduce the prevalence of this newly identified disease state. Some draw parallels
      to tobacco and the morbidity and mortality associated with its use. Perhaps there
      are similarities in these two epidemics. Both start with education of the
      population as to the morbidities and mortality associated with the disease. As
      with tobacco, this education is especially important for youth. Without a plan of
      education to promote nutrition and increased physical activity, and continued
      research into the causes of obesity, the prevalence of obesity will continue to
      rise in the United States.

TI  - Racial differences in the treatment of pigmentation disorders in outpatient
      settings: analysis of US national practice data.
PG  - 227-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pigmentary disorders tend to disproportionately affect individuals
      with darker skin pigmentation. An understanding of why certain patients or races 
      present more frequently to physicians would help guide attempts for early
      interventions and education for these patients. METHODS: Data from the National
      Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1996-2000) were used to examine associations
      between the race/ethnicity of the patient and the type of skin-related visit. We 
      examined the impact of non-white (and separately, black) individuals and Hispanic
      ethnicity on the probability of a pigmentary disorder or non-pigmentary
      disorder-related outpatient physician visit in weighted multivariate logistic
      regression models. RESULTS: Non-white patients have a higher probability of a
      pigmentary disorder-related skin condition visit than white patients (RR: 1.30;
      95% CI: 1.29, 1.31). Black patients are more likely than non-black patients to be
      seen for a pigmentary disorder (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.04). Hispanic patients 
      are less likely to be seen for a pigmentary disorder (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.90,
      0.91). This is in contrast to non-pigmentary skin disorder-related visits, where 
      non-white, black, as well as Hispanic patients have a lower probability of visits
      than white individuals. CONCLUSIONS: There is a race-related differential in the 
      treatment of pigmentary skin disorders, with non-white patients having a
      probability of receiving more care for these conditions in US outpatient
      settings. This lends support to our hypothesis that darker pigmentation in
      non-white populations is the driver of a differential in the utilization of
      pigmentation-related skin visits.

TI  - Sustained radiographic and clinical response in patient with bifrontal recurrent 
      glioblastoma multiforme with intracerebral infusion of the recombinant targeted
      toxin TP-38: case study.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme remains refractory to conventional therapy, and novel
      therapeutic modalities are desperately needed. TP-38 is a recombinant chimeric
      protein containing a genetically engineered form of the cytotoxic Pseudomonas
      exotoxin fused to transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha. TGF-alpha binds with
      high affinity to the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is uniformly
      overexpressed in malignant gliomas, often because of gene amplification. Prior to
      therapy with TP-38, the patient described here was completely refractory to
      multiple other therapies, with radiographic and pathologic evidence of tumor
      progression. After therapy, she improved clinically, was weaned off steroids and 
      anti-convulsants, and experienced a progressive decrease in enhancing tumor
      volume. Despite multiple prior recurrences, she has not progressed for >43 months
      after TP-38 therapy. Small remaining areas of enhancement demonstrate no evidence
      of tumor histologically and are hypometabolic on positron emission tomography.
      This report describes a dramatic and sustained clinical and radiographic response
      in a patient with a bifrontal glioblastoma multiforme treated with intratumoral
      infusion of a novel targeted toxin, TP-38.

PG  - 733-6
AB  - The protein chip surface enhanced laser desorption/ionisation (SELDI) technique
      is a highly versatile analytical mass spectrometry system with considerable
      potential for detection, identification and quantitation of protein complex
      mixtures. Astrocytoma is a tumour of the astrocytes with a very poor prognosis.
      There is no effective biomarker system for detection of astrocytoma. The SELDI
      technique was used to study differential protein expression in astrocytoma cells 
      in comparison to normal brain astrocytes. Several novel proteins were found to be
      expressed in the astrocytoma cells, not present in the astrocytes.

TI  - Hyperpigmentation: a review of common treatment options.
PG  - 668-73
AB  - Hyperpigmentation disorders are common and include a multitude of forms. They are
      typically divided into three large categories: dermal, epidermal, or mixed,
      depending on the site of abnormality. The location of the increased melanin
      affects treatment options, but therapy within a group is often similar. This
      paper discusses the treatment modalities, including topical and surgical
      approaches, available for the different types of hyperpigmentation.

TI  - A non-crosslinking platinum-acridine hybrid agent shows enhanced cytotoxicity
      compared to clinical BCNU and cisplatin in glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 443-6
AB  - Using clonogenic survival assays, we demonstrated that a new platinum-acridine
      hybrid agent, PT-ACRAMTU, is cytotoxic in SNB19 and U87MG glioblastoma cells at
      low-micromolar concentrations. PT-ACRAMTU is more cytotoxic than ACRAMTU (the
      platinum-free acridine), acts in a time and dose dependent manner, and appears to
      generate an apoptotic response in both cell lines on the basis of increased
      caspase-3 activity.

TI  - Frequency and significance of schistocytes in TTP/HUS patients at the
      discontinuation of plasma exchange therapy.
PG  - 165-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome
      (TTP/HUS) is characterized by thrombocytopenia, a microangiopathic hemolytic
      anemia (presence of schistocytes) and elevated LDH without another likely
      explanation. Standard of care is daily plasma exchange, which is typically
      discontinued when the platelet count exceeds 100-150 x 10(9)/L for 2 days.
      However, residual schistocytosis, the presence of schistocytes at the time of
      discontinuation of plasma exchange therapy, is often disconcerting. We evaluated 
      the frequency and significance of residual schistocytosis in TTP/HUS patients
      when the patients' platelet counts returned to normal levels (e.g., 100-150 x
      10(9)/L). METHODS: Retrospective review in our institution from 01/1999-03/2004
      of all patients treated with plasma exchange for TTP/HUS with at least 2 months
      of follow-up for relapse was completed. Patients were excluded if the clinical
      course was complicated by HIV, stem cell/bone marrow and solid organ transplant, 
      pregnancy and auto-immune disease. Schistocytes were documented on day of
      presentation and on the day the platelet count reached 150 x 10(9)/L. Grading
      scale (using 100 x objective-a high power field, with approximately 100 red blood
      cells per field) for schistocytes was as follows: rare for 1 schistocyte per
      every other other field, 1+ for 1-5%, 2+ for 6-15%, and 3+ for >15%. The
      frequency of schistocytes was compared to frequency of relapse within 2 months,
      using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We identified 57 patients with TTP/HUS who
      received plasma exchange therapy. Of these patients, 12 did not have a follow-up 
      microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear at discontinuation of plasma 
      exchange therapy and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 45
      patients, 16 had residual schistocytosis (35.6%). There was no statistically
      significant difference in relapse rate with or without residual schistocytosis (P
      = 1.00, Fisher's Exact test, 2 sided). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that 
      the presence of residual schistocytosis is common (35.6%). The presence of
      residual schistocytosis, however, was not predictive of relapse.

TI  - Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.
PG  - 48-62
AB  - Hemolytic anemia due to immune function is one of the major causes of acquired
      hemolytic anemia. In recent years, as more is known about the immune system,
      these entities have become better understood and their treatment improved. In
      this section, we will discuss three areas in which this progress has been
      apparent. In Section I, Dr. Peter Hillmen outlines the recent findings in the
      pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), relating the
      biochemical defect (the lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol [GPI]-linked
      proteins on the cell surface) to the clinical manifestations, particularly
      hemolysis (and its effects) and thrombosis. He discusses the pathogenesis of the 
      disorder in the face of marrow dysfunction insofar as it is known. His major
      emphasis is on innovative therapies that are designed to decrease the
      effectiveness of complement activation, since the lack of cellular modulation of 
      this system is the primary cause of the pathology of the disease. He recounts his
      considerable experience with a humanized monoclonal antibody against C5, which
      has a remarkable effect in controlling the manifestations of the disease. Other
      means of controlling the action of complement include replacing the missing
      modulatory proteins on the cell surface; these studies are not as developed as
      the former agent. In Section II, Dr. Alan Schreiber describes the biochemistry,
      genetics, and function of the Fc gamma receptors and their role in the
      pathobiology of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic
      purpura due to IgG antibodies. He outlines the complex varieties of these
      molecules, showing how they vary in genetic origin and in function. These
      variations can be related to three-dimensional topography, which is known in some
      detail. Liganding IgG results in the transduction of a signal through the
      tyrosine-based activation motif and Syk signaling. The role of these receptors in
      the pathogenesis of hematological diseases due to IgG antibodies is outlined and 
      the potential of therapy of these diseases by regulation of these receptors is
      discussed. In Section III, Dr. Wendell Rosse discusses the forms of autoimmune
      hemolytic anemia characterized by antibodies that react preferentially in the
      cold-cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). The former
      is due to IgM antibodies with a common but particular structure that reacts
      primarily with carbohydrate or carbohydrate-containing antigens, an interaction
      that is diminished at body temperature. PCH is a less common but probably
      underdiagnosed illness due to an IgG antibody reacting with a carbohydrate
      antigen; improved techniques for the diagnosis of PCH are described. Therapy for 
      the two disorders differs somewhat because of the differences in isotype of the
      antibody. Since the hemolysis in both is primarily due to complement activation, 
      the potential role of its control, as by the monoclonal antibody described by Dr.
      Hillmen, is discussed.

TI  - The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin modulates gene expression and represses
      the extracellular matrix protein laminin gamma1 in human glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 244-52
AB  - The induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is associated with more
      aggressive gliomas and poor survival. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) inhibit COX activity and have antitumorigenic properties. In this
      report, our initial aim was to determine if indomethacin would alter gene
      expression as measured by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Three
      up-regulated and four down-regulated genes by indomethacin treatment were
      identified. Laminin gamma1, an extracellular matrix molecule, was the most
      significantly repressed gene. The repression of laminin gamma1 by indomethacin
      was confirmed by Northern and Western blot analyses and occurred in a
      concentration- and time-dependent manner at the protein level. Among several
      NSAIDs tested, only sulindac sulfide and indomethacin suppressed laminin gamma1
      protein expression, and this repression was observed in both COX-expressing and
      -deficient cell lines, suggesting that laminin gamma1 repression by COX
      inhibitors was independent of COX. Indomethacin, at a concentration that
      represses laminin gamma1, inhibited glioblastoma cell invasion that was partially
      restored with additional human laminin protein containing gamma1 chain. The
      repression of laminin gamma1 by NSAIDs may be related to attenuation of invasion 
      of brain tumors. These findings are important in understanding the
      chemopreventive activity of some NSAIDs and could be relevant for designing
      therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma.

TI  - Thymic transplantation for complete DiGeorge syndrome: medical and surgical
      considerations.
PG  - 1607-15
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Complete DiGeorge syndrome results in the absence of
      functional T cells. Our program supports the transplantation of allogeneic thymic
      tissue in infants with DiGeorge syndrome to reconstitute immune function. This
      study reviews the multidisciplinary care of these complex infants. METHODS: From 
      1991 to 2001, the authors evaluated 16 infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome.
      All infants received multidisciplinary medical and surgical support. Clinical
      records for the group were reviewed. RESULTS: Four infants died without receiving
      a thymic transplantation, and 12 children survived to transplantation. The mean
      age at time of transplantation was 2.7 months (range, 1.1 to 4.4 months). All 16 
      infants had significant comorbidity including congenital heart disease (16 of
      16), hypocalcemia (14 of 16), gastroesophageal reflux disease or aspiration (13
      of 16), CHARGE complex (4 of 16), and other organ involvement (14 of 16).
      Nontransplant surgical procedures included central line placement (15 of 16),
      fundoplication or gastrostomy (10 of 16), cardiac repair (10 of 16), bronchoscopy
      or tracheostomy (6 of 16), and other procedures (12 of 16). Complications were
      substantial, and 5 of the 12 transplanted infants died of nontransplant-related
      conditions. All surviving infants have immune reconstitution, with follow-up from
      2 to 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although the transplantation of thymic tissue can
      restore immune function in infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome, these
      children have substantial comorbidity. Care of these children requires
      coordinated multidisciplinary support.

TI  - Regulation of P2Y1 receptor-mediated signaling by the ectonucleoside triphosphate
      diphosphohydrolase isozymes NTPDase1 and NTPDase2.
PG  - 114-22
AB  - Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) control the
      concentration of released extracellular nucleotides, but the precise
      physiological roles played by these isozymes in modulation of P2 receptor
      signaling remain unclear. Activation of the human P2Y(1) receptor was studied in 
      the presence of NTPDase1 or NTPDase2 expressed either in the same cell as the
      receptor or in P2Y(1) receptor-expressing cells cocultured with NTPDaseexpressing
      cells. Coexpression of NTPDase1 with the P2Y(1) receptor resulted in increases in
      the EC(50) for 2'-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate (2MeSADP; 12-fold), ADP
      (50-fold), and ATP (10-fold) for activation of phospholipase C. Similar effects
      were observed when the P2Y(1) receptor and NTPDase1 were expressed on different
      cells. These results are explained by the capacity of NTPDase1 to hydrolyze both 
      nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates. NTPDase2 preferentially hydrolyzes
      nucleoside triphosphates, and the presence of NTPDase2 under either coexpression 
      or coculture conditions did not change the EC(50) of 2MeSADP, ADP, or adenosine
      5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) for activation of the P2Y(1) receptor. However, the
      EC(50) for ATP was 15-fold lower in the presence of NTPDase2 than in cells
      expressing the P2Y(1) receptor alone. Whereas expression of NTPDase1 decreased
      basal activity of the P2Y(1) receptor, the presence of the NTPDase2 resulted in
      P2Y(1) receptor-dependent increases in basal activity. These results suggest that
      basal activity of the P2Y(1) receptor is maintained by paracrine or autocrine
      release of receptor agonists and that the biological and/or pharmacological
      response mediated by P2Y receptors in target tissues is highly dependent on the
      types of ectonucleotidases expressed in the vicinity of the receptor.

TI  - Ultrasonographic appearance of Dandy Walker-like Syndrome in a Boston Terrier.
PG  - 336-9
AB  - Congenital cerebellar disorders can be caused by in utero or neonatal infections,
      genetic aberrations causing malformations, and neurodegenerative processes. Most 
      congenital cerebellar disorders are diagnosed definitively with histopathology.
      However, antemortem diagnosis of cerebellar malformations can be made by imaging 
      the brain. This paper describes the antemortem appearance of a congenital
      cerebellar malformation in a Boston Terrier puppy on ultrasound images. This
      appearance was compared with the postmortem findings that were comparable to
      Dandy Walker Syndrome in humans. A previous report of this syndrome in Boston
      Terriers suggests the problem may be inherited in this breed.

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies for brain tumour treatment.
PG  - 1453-71
AB  - Conventional treatment of brain tumours includes surgical, radiotherapeutic and
      chemotherapeutic modalities. Nonetheless, the outcome of patients with brain
      tumours, in particular glioblastoma, remains poor. Immunotherapy with armed or
      unarmed monoclonal antibodies targeting tumour-specific antigens has emerged in
      the last two decades as a novel potential adjuvant treatment for all types of
      neoplasia. Many challenges to its implementation as a safe and viable therapy for
      brain tumours still need to be addressed; nevertheless, results from ongoing
      Phase I/II clinical trials are encouraging, as disease stabilisation and patient 
      survival prolongation have been observed. Advances in preclinical and clinical
      research indicate that treatment of brain tumours with monoclonal antibodies can 
      be increasingly adjusted to the characteristics of the targeted tumour and its
      environment. This aspect relies on the careful selection of the target antigen
      and corresponding specific monoclonal antibody, and antibody format (size, class,
      affinity), conjugation to the appropriate toxin or radioactive isotope
      (half-life, range), and proper compartmental administration.

TI  - A morphologic study of the vasculature of malignant gliomas using thick celloidin
      sections and alkaline phosphatase stain.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - The combination of 100 microm thick celloidin sections and alkaline phosphatase
      (AP) enzyme histochemistry of the vascular endothelium offers a greatly enhanced,
      3D morphologic perspective and reveals intricate details of the vasculature of
      brain. A study of tumor specimens obtained at craniotomy from 6 patients with
      glioblastomas, 1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma and 1 with juvenile pilocytic 
      astrocytoma was undertaken using this technique. Five of the 6 glioblastomas, the
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma and the low-grade astrocytoma specimen showed
      uniform staining of afferent tumor blood vessels. In the glioblastomas, newly
      formed vessels formed dense, festooned networks at the advancing edges of the
      tumor. Feeding arteries entered the tumor at the junction between the edge of the
      tumor and adjacent brain or meninges and proceeded to form striking, coiled
      vessels and smaller branches. The density of both small arteries and veins was
      greatly increased within the tumor although there was much variability.
      Disordered arborization, arteriole to venous and arteriole to arteriole shunts
      were observed, leading to a situation where arteries connected directly to veins.
      In necrotic areas, there were often no AP-stained vessels. In many places,
      arterioles and capillaries were lacking. Numerous AP-negative veins of various
      sizes drained the tumors. Glomeruloid proliferations were presumptively
      identified as focal stain smudges or clusters of capillaries arising from nearby 
      vascular channels. Increased alkaline phosphatase staining and/or focal new
      vessels were seen outside necrotic areas. The pilocytic astrocytoma and the
      oligodendroglioma showed less dense vascularity and no formation of the focal
      festoons of vessels shown by the glioblastomas. This technique may be useful for 
      the study of tumor angiogenesis and to evaluate vascularity in experimental and
      human brain tumors after various therapies.

TI  - CT and MR imaging after placement of the GliaSite radiation therapy system to
      treat brain tumor: initial experience.
PG  - 1211-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The GliaSite system delivers local, high radiation after 
      brain tumor resection. We describe the imaging appearance of the device and the
      changes it causes. METHODS: Eight patients with brain tumors were treated with
      this system. After surgery, all underwent MR imaging, and one underwent CT. Five 
      were examined 1 month after radioactive unloading and every 2 months thereafter
      (total, 6-9 months). Initial studies were assessed for balloon appearance and
      complications; subsequent studies, for signal intensity and enhancement. Three
      patients underwent multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy, and one underwent MR
      perfusion study. Spectra were reviewed for metabolites suggesting tumor;
      perfusion studies were reviewed for increased relative cerebral blood volume and 
      flow. RESULTS: CT showed the hyperattenuating balloon with considerable artifact.
      All MR images showed the device and adjacent brain. Follow-up studies showed
      enhancement and T2 hyperintensity in five patients. In one, enhancement
      progressively disappeared with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Another patient
      had progressive enhancement and low relative cerebral blood volume and flow;
      biopsy showed necrosis and inflammation. One patient had progressive enhancement 
      and high choline levels (proved anaplastic astrocytoma). In another, T2 signal
      intensity and contrast enhancement progressed owing to tumor and bacterial
      infection. The last patient had a high choline level (proved radionecrosis);
      enhancement progressed over 5 months. In three, the device was removed early
      because of bleeding, mass effect, and therapeutic changes (no follow-up).
      CONCLUSION: Good balloon visualization was possible with MR imaging. After
      brachytherapy, all patients developed T2 hyperintensity; stable or progressive
      enhancement occurred with tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. High choline levels
      were suggestive of, but not necessarily diagnostic of, tumor.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation after pulmonary transplant.
PG  - 496-500
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) is thought to occur
      commonly after pulmonary transplantation, little is known about the epidemiology,
      risk factors, or clinical significance of arrhythmia in this population. The aim 
      of the current study was to determine the incidence, clinical predictors, and
      associated morbidity of AF after lung transplant. METHODS: The records of 200
      consecutive adult patients who underwent lung transplantation at a single
      institution from August 1998 to June 2002 were studied. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis was performed to define the predictors for posttransplant AF.
      RESULTS: Indications for transplant included COPD in 43%, cystic fibrosis in 18%,
      and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 17%. The transplants were bilateral
      (79%) or single lung (21%). The mean age of the patients was 50 years (range, 19 
      to 66 years; median, 54 years). Postoperative AF within 14 days of transplant
      occurred in 78 patients (39%), with a mean onset of 3.8 +/- 3.0 days (+/- SD).
      Significant predictors of AF were as follows: age >or= 50 years (odds ratio [OR],
      2.1; p = 0.01), IPF (OR, 2.3; p = 0.03), existing coronary disease (OR, 2.0; p = 
      0.009), enlarged left atrium (LA) on echocardiography (OR, 3.9; p = 0.05), and
      number of postoperative vasopressors (OR, 1.5; p = 0.03). Patients with AF had
      longer hospital stays (32.4 +/- 60.0 days vs 17.5 +/- 24.1 days, p = 0.04), were 
      more likely to undergo tracheostomy (OR, 3.6; p = 0.0003), and had more
      in-hospital deaths (OR, 5.7; p = 0.0005) than patients without AF. CONCLUSIONS:
      AF is a frequent complication after lung transplant. Advanced age, IPF, known
      coronary disease, enlarged LA, and use of postoperative vasopressors increase the
      risk for developing AF. The development of posttransplant AF is associated with
      significantly prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Prospective
      studies designed to prevent posttransplant AF are needed to clarify the extent to
      which AF impacts on posttransplant outcomes.

TI  - Mutations of PIK3CA in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, high-grade astrocytomas,
      and medulloblastomas.
PG  - 5048-50
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway is activated in multiple advanced
      cancers, including glioblastomas, through inactivation of the PTEN tumor
      suppressor gene. Recently, mutations in PIK3CA, a member of the family of
      phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase catalytic subunits, were identified in a
      significant fraction (25-30%) of colorectal cancers, gastric cancers, and
      glioblastomas and in a smaller fraction of breast and lung cancers. These
      mutations were found to cluster into two major "hot spots" located in the helical
      and catalytic domains. To determine whether PIK3CA is genetically altered in
      brain tumors, we performed a large-scale mutational analysis of the helical and
      catalytic domains. A total of 13 mutations of PIK3CA within these specific
      domains were identified in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic
      astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme, and medulloblastomas, whereas no mutations
      were identified in ependymomas or low-grade astrocytomas. These observations
      implicate PIK3CA as an oncogene in a wider spectrum of adult and pediatric brain 
      tumors and suggest that PIK3CA may be a useful diagnostic marker or a therapeutic
      target in these cancers.

      criteria and patient survival. To date, histological grade, patient age, and
      clinical performance, as reflected in the Karnofsky score, are the most reliable 
      prognostic predictors. Recently, there has been a significant effort to identify 
      additional prognostic markers using objective molecular genetic techniques. We
      believe that the identification of such markers will characterize new chromosomal
      loci important in astrocytoma progression and aid clinical diagnosis and
      prognosis. To this end, our laboratory used comparative genomic hybridization to 
      identify DNA sequence copy number changes in 102 astrocytomas. Novel losses of
      19p loci were detected in low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas and losses of loci on 
      9p, 10, and 22 along with gains on 7, 19, and 20 were detected in a significant
      proportion of high-grade astrocytomas. The Cox proportional hazards statistical
      modeling showed that the presence of +7q and -10q comparative genomic
      hybridization alterations significantly increased a patient's risk of dying,
      independent of histological grade. This investigation demonstrates the efficacy
      of comparative genomic hybridization for identifying tumor suppressor and
      oncogene loci in different astrocytic grades. The cumulative effect of these loci
      is an important consideration in their diagnostic and prognostic implications.

TI  - Linear nevus comedonicus with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
PG  - 502-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nevus comedonicus (NC) is rarely associated with the histopathologic 
      pattern of follicular epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK). We found eight cases
      reported. In one case, the condition was transmitted to the offspring in the form
      of generalized EHK. METHODS: We describe a case of linear NC with EHK in a
      46-year-old woman. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination revealed the typical
      features of NC. Additionally, the follicular epithelial walls showed EHK with
      characteristic perinuclear vacuolization in the stratum spinosum and stratum
      granulosum and large, irregular keratohyalin granules in the granular cell layer.
      CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and histopathologic features of this case are
      consistent with a diagnosis of linear NC with EHK. Lesions of NC suspected by
      clinical exam should be examined microscopically to look for features of EHK. If 
      present, patients should be educated about the risk, albeit rare, of passing on a
      more severe form of the disorder to subsequent generations.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of irinotecan plus BCNU in patients with progressive or recurrent
      malignant glioma.
PG  - 145-53
AB  - Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor previously shown to be active in the
      treatment of malignant glioma. We now report the results of a phase 1 trial of
      irinotecan plus BCNU, or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, for patients with 
      recurrent or progressive MG. Irinotecan dose escalation occurred independently
      within 2 strata: patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) 
      and patients not receiving EIAEDs. BCNU was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2
      over 1 h every 6 weeks on the same day as the first irinotecan dose was
      administered. Irinotecan was administered intravenously over 90 min once weekly. 
      Treatment cycles consisted of 4 weekly administrations of irinotecan followed by 
      a 2-week rest with dose escalation in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients. Seventy-three
      patients were treated, including 49 patients who were on EIAEDs and 24 who were
      not on EIAEDs. The maximum tolerated dose for patients not on EIAEDs was 125
      mg/m2. The maximum tolerated dose for patients on EIAEDs was 225 mg/m2.
      Dose-limiting toxicity was evenly distributed among the following organ systems: 
      pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic, infectious, and
      hematologic, without a clear predominance of toxicity involving any one organ
      system. There was no evidence of increasing incidence of toxicity involving one
      organ system as irinotecan dose was escalated. On the basis of these results, we 
      conclude that the recommended doses of irinotecan for a phase 2 clinical trial
      when given in combination with BCNU (100 mg/m2) are 225 mg/m2 for patients on
      EIAEDs and 125 mg/m2 for patients not on EIAEDs.

TI  - Phase 2 trial of BCNU plus irinotecan in adults with malignant glioma.
PG  - 134-44
AB  - In preclinical studies, BCNU, or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, plus
      CPT-11 (irinotecan) exhibits schedule-dependent, synergistic activity against
      malignant glioma (MG). We previously established the maximum tolerated dose of
      CPT-11 when administered for 4 consecutive weeks in combination with BCNU
      administered on the first day of each 6-week cycle. We now report a phase 2 trial
      of BCNU plus CPT-11 for patients with MG. In the current study, BCNU (100 mg/m2) 
      was administered on day 1 of each 6-week cycle. CPT-11 was administered on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22 at 225 mg/m2 for patients receiving CYP3A1- or CYP3A4-inducing
      anticonvulsants and at 125 mg/m2 for those not on these medications. Newly
      diagnosed patients received up to 3 cycles before radiotherapy, while recurrent
      patients received up to 8 cycles. The primary end point of this study was
      radiographic response, while time to progression and overall survival were also
      assessed. Seventy-six patients were treated, including 37 with newly diagnosed
      tumors and 39 with recurrent disease. Fifty-six had glioblastoma multiforme, 18
      had anaplastic astrocytoma, and 2 had anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Toxicities
      (grade > or =3) included infections (13%), thromboses (12%), diarrhea (10%), and 
      neutropenia (7%). Interstitial pneumonitis developed in 4 patients. Five newly
      diagnosed patients (14%; 95% CI, 5%-29%) achieved a radiographic response (1
      complete response and 4 partial responses). Five patients with recurrent MG also 
      achieved a response (1 complete response and 4 partial responses; 13%; 95% CI,
      4%-27%). More than 40% of both newly diagnosed and recurrent patients achieved
      stable disease. Median time to progression was 11.3 weeks for recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme patients and 16.9 weeks for recurrent anaplastic
      astrocytoma/ anaplastic oligodendroglioma patients. We conclude that the activity
      of BCNU plus CPT-11 for patients with MG appears comparable to that of CPT-11
      alone and may be more toxic.

TI  - Endoscopic third ventriculostomy in infants of less than 1 year of age: which
      factors influence the outcome?
PG  - 405-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a successful method of
      treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus. In infants, however, it is reported to
      have a higher failure rate. On the basis of our own data and a meta-analysis of
      the literature, we try to define factors prognosticating potential failure in
      infants aged less than 1 year. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively.
      Between October 1994 and October 2002, 20 ETVs were performed in 16 patients
      younger than 1 year. Ages ranged from 8 to 311 days (median 103). Etiology was
      aqueductal stenosis in all 16 patients (idiopathic in 7, posthemorrhagic in 3,
      postmeningitic in 3, and related to CNS or vascular malformation in 3). ETV
      failure was defined as subsequent need for shunt implantation. For non-shunted
      patients, follow up was 16-52 months (median 25). RESULTS: ETV was successful in 
      5 patients and eventually failed in 11. There was no mortality or permanent
      morbidity following ETV. In the successful cases, etiology was idiopathic
      aqueductal stenosis in 4 and postmeningitic aqueductal stenosis in 1; the median 
      age was 206 days (range 82-311). In the 11 unsuccessful patients, it was
      idiopathic aqueductal stenosis in 3, posthemorrhagic in 3, postmeningitic in 2
      and CNS/vascular malformation in 3 cases; median age was 94 days (range 8-299).
      Median time interval between (last) ETV and shunt was 38 days (range 2-70). The
      difference in median age between the success group and the failure group roughly 
      corresponded to data gained from a meta-analysis of the literature. Four patients
      underwent a second ETV. In intraoperative ventriculoscopy, the stoma was closed
      or there were new membranes below the floor of the third ventricle and a second
      ETV was performed. But finally, all re-ETVs failed and the patients needed a
      shunt. CONCLUSION: Factors indicating potential failure of ETV were very young
      age and etiology other than idiopathic aqueductal stenosis. Probability of
      success seems to increase during the first 2 or 3 months of life. Ventriculoscopy
      with the option of a second ETV should be regularly performed after failure of
      ETV.

TI  - Complete DiGeorge syndrome: development of rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal
      T cells in 5 cases.
PG  - 734-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Five patients with DiGeorge syndrome presented with infections, skin 
      rashes, and lymphadenopathy after the newborn period. T-cell counts and function 
      varied greatly in each patient. Initial laboratory testing did not suggest
      athymia in these patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether the patients had significant immunodeficiency. METHODS: Research testing 
      of peripheral blood included immunoscope evaluation of T-cell receptor beta
      variable gene segment repertoire diversity, quantification of T-cell receptor
      rearrangement excision circles, and detection of naive T cells (expressing CD45RA
      and CD62L). RESULTS: The patients were classified as having DiGeorge syndrome on 
      the basis of syndromic associations and heart, parathyroid, and immune
      abnormalities. Immunoscope evaluation revealed that the T-cell repertoires were
      strikingly oligoclonal in all patients. There were few recent thymic emigrants,
      as indicated by the very low numbers of naive T cells (<50/mm(3)) and the absence
      of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles. These studies showed that all 
      5 patients were athymic. Two patients died, one from infection. No thymus was
      found during the complete autopsy performed on one patient. CONCLUSION: Patients 
      with DiGeorge syndrome, skin rash, and lymphadenopathy should undergo analysis of
      naive T-cell numbers and of T-cell receptor beta variability segment repertoire
      to determine whether they are athymic, even if they have T cells with mitogen
      responsiveness. It is important for physicians to realize that patients with
      complete DiGeorge syndrome remain profoundly immunodeficient after development of
      these atypical features (rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal T cells). Prompt 
      diagnosis is necessary for appropriate management.

TI  - Postnatal thymus transplantation with immunosuppression as treatment for DiGeorge
      syndrome.
PG  - 2574-81
AB  - Complete DiGeorge syndrome is a fatal congenital disorder characterized by
      athymia, hypoparathyroidism, and heart defects. Less than half of patients are
      22q11 hemizygous. The goal of this study was to assess if immune suppression
      followed by postnatal thymus transplantation would lead to T-cell function in 6
      infant patients who had host T cells at the time of transplantation. All infants 
      had fewer than 50 recent thymic emigrants (CD3(+)CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) per cubic
      millimeter (mm(3)) and all had some proliferative response to the mitogen
      phytohemagglutinin. Four infants had rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal
      populations of T cells in the periphery. Five of 6 patients are alive at the
      follow-up interval of 15 months to 30 months. The 5 surviving patients developed 
      a mean of 983 host CD3(+) T cells/mm(3) (range, 536/mm(3)-1574/mm(3)), a mean of 
      437 recent thymic emigrants/mm(3) (range, 196/mm(3)-785/mm(3)), and normal
      proliferative responses to phytohemaglutinin (follow-up from day 376 to day 873).
      The TCR repertoire became polyclonal in patients who presented with oligoclonal T
      cells. All patients had thymopoiesis on allograft biopsy. Postnatal thymus
      transplantation after treatment with Thymoglobulin shows promise as therapy for
      infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome who have significant proliferative
      responses to mitogens or who develop rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal T
      cells.

TI  - Pulmonary complications of primary immunodeficiencies.
PG  - S225-33
AB  - In the fifty years since Ogden Bruton discovered agammaglobulinemia, more than
      100 additional immunodeficiency syndromes have been described. These disorders
      may involve one or more components of the immune system, including T, B, and NK
      lymphocytes; phagocytic cells; and complement proteins. Most are recessive
      traits, some of which are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome,
      others in genes on autosomal chromosomes. Until the past decade, there was little
      insight into the fundamental problems underlying a majority of these conditions. 
      Many of the primary immunodeficiency diseases have now been mapped to specific
      chromosomal locations, and the fundamental biologic errors have been identified
      in more than 3 dozen. Within the past decade the molecular bases of 7 X-linked
      immunodeficiency disorders have been reported: X-linked immunodeficiency with
      Hyper IgM, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, X-linked agammaglobulinemia,
      X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, nuclear 
      factor kappaB essential modulator (NEMO or IKKg), and the immune dysregulation
      polyendocrinopathy (IPEX) syndrome. The abnormal genes in X-linked chronic
      granulomatous disease (CGD) and properdin deficiency had been identified several 
      years earlier. In addition, there are now many autosomal recessive
      immunodeficiencies for which the molecular bases have been discovered. These new 
      advances will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on the pulmonary
      complications of some of these diseases. In some cases there are unique features 
      of lung abnormalities in specific defects. Infections obviously account for most 
      of these complications, but the host reaction to infection often leads to
      characteristic findings that can be helpful diagnostically. Finally, advances in 
      treatment of the underlying diseases as well as their infectious complications
      will be covered.

TI  - Relationship among basilar artery resistance index, degree of ventriculomegaly,
      and clinical signs in hydrocephalic dogs.
PG  - 687-94
AB  - Forty-four transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies were performed in 36 dogs. The
      ratio of the height of the ventricle to the height of the brain (VB ratio) was
      calculated to determine the severity of ventriculomegaly. Resistance index (RI)
      was calculated from Doppler measurements of the blood flow velocity in the
      basilar artery and neurologic signs were scored on a scale of 0 to 3. Based on
      clinical and ultrasonographic findings, dogs were divided into four groups
      (normal controls, asymptomatic hydrocephalus, symptomatic hydrocephalus, and
      other intracranial disease). RI and VB ratio were compared between the groups of 
      dogs and compared with neurologic signs in hydrocephalic dogs. RI ranged from
      0.50 to 0.81 (mean, 0.68). Resistance index was significantly higher in dogs with
      symptomatic hydrocephalus and other intracranial disease when compared with the
      other two groups. The degree of ventriculomegaly was significantly higher in dogs
      with symptomatic hydrocephalus than the other groups, but there was substantial
      overlap between asymptomatic and symptomatic hydrocephalus groups. Combining
      measurements of VB ratio and RI allowed detection of symptomatic hydrocephalus
      with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 94%. The severity of neurological 
      signs was significantly correlated with RI and with VB ratio in hydrocephalic
      dogs, and in dogs evaluated on more than one occasion, changes in neurologic
      status were accompanied by changes in RI but not in VB ratio. All asymptomatic
      hydrocephalic dogs with a VB ratio of greater than 60% eventually developed
      neurologic signs. Our results suggest that ultrasonographic measurement of VB
      ratio and basilar artery RI may allow identification of dogs with symptomatic
      hydrocephalus or dogs that are at risk of developing symptomatic hydrocephalus.
      Repeated RI measurements are a useful means of monitoring dogs with a variety of 
      intracranial diseases.

TI  - Recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-SAM2) immunotherapy
      with ranimustine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy for malignant
      astrocytomas.
PG  - 4473-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the safety, tolerance and preliminary efficacy of
      a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of ranimustine (MCNU) and
      recombinant human mutant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-SAM2) for patients with
      newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant astrocytomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      initial regimens were prescribed as adjuvant therapy in conjunction with
      radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment. Ranimustine (MCNU) was
      administered intravenously at 100 mg/m2 on Day 1, i.e., at the onset of radiation
      therapy, and was followed by 80 x 10(4) U/m2 TNF-SAM2 intravenously from Day 3.
      TNF-SAM2 was prescribed weekly for up to 5 injections during the postoperative
      period concurrent with radiation therapy. TNF-SAM2 and MCNU were given each 8- to
      12-week cycle until tumor progression was evident, or for a total of four cycles 
      over a 1-year period. The primary end-points were safety and tolerability and the
      secondary end-point was overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-six consecutive
      eligible patients, including 5 with anaplastic astrocytoma (3 men and 2 women)
      and 21 with glioblastoma (13 men and 8 women), were treated. All of the 3
      evaluable patients with anaplastic astrocytoma partially responded to treatment
      (PR), with a time to tumor progression (TTP) of 107 weeks and an estimated median
      survival time of 330 weeks. Of the 15 evaluable patients with glioblastoma, 8
      (53.3%) showed no change in response to the treatment (NC), while 7 (46.7%) had
      progressive disease (PD), with a time to tumor progression (TTP) of 36 weeks and 
      an estimated median survival time of 69 weeks. Although this regimen appeared to 
      be safe, there was no improvement in response or survival time compared with a
      historical control of patients who received chemotherapy with MCNU alone in
      conjunction with radiotherapy for glioblastoma. Neither neurological toxicity,
      severe or life-threatening hematological toxicity, nor fatal toxicity (WHO Grade 
      4) was experienced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that combined chemotherapy 
      with mutant TNF-alpha (TNF-SAM2) in this patient population seems to be safe and 
      tolerable and may benefit those with anaplastic astrocytoma. These intriguing
      clinical observations warrant further evaluation to determine whether this
      approach can provide therapeutic benefits and improve survival.

TI  - Progress report of a Phase I study of the intracerebral microinfusion of a
      recombinant chimeric protein composed of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha
      and a mutated form of the Pseudomonas exotoxin termed PE-38 (TP-38) for the
      treatment of malignant brain tumors.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - TP-38 is a recombinant chimeric targeted toxin composed of the EGFR binding
      ligand TGF-alpha and a genetically engineered form of the Pseudomonas exotoxin,
      PE-38. After in vitro and in vivo animal studies that showed specific activity
      and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), we investigated this agent in a
      Phase I trial. The primary objective of this study was to define the MTD and dose
      limiting toxicity of TP-38 delivered by convection-enhanced delivery in patients 
      with recurrent malignant brain tumors. Twenty patients were enrolled in the study
      and doses were escalated from 25 ng/mL to 100 with a 40 mL infusion volume
      delivered by two catheters. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100
      ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established. The overall median survival
      after TP-38 for all patients was 23 weeks whereas for those without radiographic 
      evidence of residual disease at the time of therapy, the median survival was 31.9
      weeks. Overall, 3 of 15 patients, with residual disease at the time of therapy,
      have demonstrated radiographic responses and one patient with a complete response
      and has survived greater than 83 weeks.

TI  - Phase II trial of gefitinib in recurrent glioblastoma.
PG  - 133-42
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa; 
      AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), a novel epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      This was an open-label, single-center phase II trial. Fifty-seven patients with
      first recurrence of a glioblastoma who were previously treated with surgical
      resection, radiation, and usually chemotherapy underwent an open biopsy or
      resection at evaluation for confirmation of tumor recurrence. Each patient
      initially received 500 mg of gefitinib orally once daily; dose escalation to 750 
      mg then 1,000 mg, if a patient received enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs or
      dexamethasone, was allowed within each patient. RESULTS: Although no objective
      tumor responses were seen among the 53 assessable patients, only 21% of patients 
      (11 of 53 patients) had measurable disease at treatment initiation. Seventeen
      percent of patients (nine of 53 patients) underwent at least six 4-week cycles,
      and the 6-month event-free survival (EFS) was 13% (seven of 53 patients). The
      median EFS time was 8.1 weeks, and the median overall survival (OS) time from
      treatment initiation was 39.4 weeks. Adverse events were generally mild (grade 1 
      or 2) and consisted mainly of skin reactions and diarrhea. Drug-related
      toxicities were more frequent at higher doses. Withdrawal caused by drug-related 
      adverse events occurred in 6% of patients (three of 53 patients). Although the
      presence of diarrhea positively predicted favorable OS from treatment initiation,
      epidermal growth factor receptor expression did not correlate with either EFS or 
      OS. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib is well tolerated and has activity in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma. Further study of this agent at higher doses is warranted.

TI  - Photo-damage in Northern European renal transplant recipients is associated with 
      use of calcium channel blockers.
PG  - 588-91
AB  - Photo-damage of the head and neck was assessed, by visual inspection, in 82
      Northern European renal transplant recipients attending a dermatology clinic.
      Photo-damage was graded as absent, mild, moderate and severe and the presence or 
      absence of skin telangiectasia, solar elastosis, erythema and pigmentation was
      assessed. The duration and type of immunosuppressant and calcium channel blocker 
      medication was recorded. Ninety percent had photo-damaged skin with 41 (50%)
      having mild photo-damage, 20 (24%) moderate photo-damage and 13 (16%) severe
      photo-damage. Sixty-two (76%) had pigmentation, 43 (52%) telangiectasia, 65 (79%)
      papular changes and 51 (65%) erythema. Fifty-three patients (65%) had received a 
      calcium channel blocker (49 nifedipine, four amlodipine). The grade of
      photo-damage was strongly associated with use of calcium channel blockers
      (P=0.001) as was the presence of telangiectasia (P=0.001) and solar elastosis
      (P=0.04). Photo-damage is frequent in this population of renal transplant
      patients. Telangiectasia in association with calcium channel blockers has been
      reported rarely but appears to be common in the transplant population.

TI  - Development and validation of a health-related quality of life instrument for
      women with melasma.
PG  - 572-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melasma can have significant emotional and psychological effects on
      those affected with the condition. In the past, the impact of melasma on
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been assessed using general measures
      of skin disease that equally weigh both the physical and psychosocial distress
      arising from the presence of a dermatological condition. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose 
      was to develop and validate a disease-specific HRQoL instrument to identify the
      areas of the patient's life most impaired by melasma as well as the effects of
      the condition on their level of functioning in correlation with disease severity:
      the Melasma Quality of Life scale (MELASQOL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A random
      sample of 102 women identified by an investigator as having melasma were
      evaluated by the investigator using the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI).
      The patients were then anonymously surveyed with the SKINDEX-16, the Fear of
      Negative Evaluation scale, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a skin
      discoloration evaluation questionnaire, and a measure of perceived life quality
      difference without melasma. The 10-item MELASQOL scale was devised from the
      comprehensive HRQoL assessment battery. RESULTS: The psychometric properties of
      the MELASQOL were comparable with the properties of the DLQI and the SKINDEX-16. 
      The MELASQOL scores were highly correlated with the other HRQoL measures. The
      discriminatory ability of the MELASQOL is superior to the SKINDEX-16 and the DLQI
      for melasma. The three life domains most adversely affected by melasma (social
      life, recreation/leisure and emotional well-being) were highlighted by this
      instrument. These were the same three areas of life that patients believed would 
      improve the most if they no longer were affected by the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The
      MELASQOL can be used to evaluate objectively the effect of melasma on a patient's
      HRQoL. The high correlation with the DLQI, the SKINDEX-16 and the skin
      discoloration questionnaire suggests that the new scale is a valid instrument,
      which can be used to monitor the level of impairment individuals suffer due to
      their melasma. The MELASQOL scores can help guide treatment methods as well as
      track the improvement of patients' HRQoL.

TI  - Autoantibodies in mothers of children with neonatal liver disease.
PG  - 262-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is associated with maternal
      anti-Ro/La autoantibodies. It is characterized by heart block and/or cutaneous
      skin lesions, and occasionally liver disease. This study was performed to
      determine whether idiopathic neonatal cholestasis (INC) represents NLE without
      its cardiac or cutaneous findings. METHODS: Sera were obtained for autoantibody
      analysis from mothers of children with INC (N = 11), biliary atresia (N = 25),
      other liver disease excluding viral hepatitis (liver disease control subjects, N 
      = 14), and healthy children (normal control subjects [NC], N = 22). RESULTS: The 
      characteristic serologic findings of NLE, high titer antibodies to Ro and/or La, 
      were absent in mothers from all groups. An unexpected finding was the prevalence 
      of autoantibodies in mothers of infants with liver disease of any type. The
      frequency of maternal antinuclear antibodies at > or = 1:120 dilution was greater
      than the estimated frequency in the general population (22% vs. 9%, P = 0.044).
      The frequency of maternal low titer autoantibodies to 52 kD Ro detected by ELISA 
      was significantly greater than in the NC group (31% vs. 5%, P = 0.014).
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cases of INC do not represent NLE. The frequent
      presence of autoantibodies in mothers of infants in all neonatal liver disease
      groups raises the possibility that maternal serologic autoimmunity is associated 
      with neonatal liver disease.

TI  - Graded phenotypic response to partial and complete deficiency of a brain-specific
      transcript variant of the winged helix transcription factor RFX4.
PG  - 4539-52
AB  - One line of mice harboring a cardiac-specific epoxygenase transgene developed
      head swelling and rapid neurological decline in young adulthood, and had marked
      hydrocephalus of the lateral and third ventricles. The transgene was found to be 
      inserted into an intron in the mouse Rfx4 locus. This insertion apparently
      prevented expression of a novel variant transcript of RFX4 (RFX4_v3), a member of
      the regulatory factor X family of winged helix transcription factors.
      Interruption of two alleles resulted in profound failure of dorsal midline brain 
      structure formation and perinatal death, presumably by interfering with
      expression of downstream genes. Interruption of a single allele prevented
      formation of the subcommissural organ, a structure important for cerebrospinal
      fluid flow through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and resulted in congenital
      hydrocephalus. These data implicate the RFX4_v3 variant transcript as being
      crucial for early brain development, as well as for the genesis of the
      subcommissural organ. These findings may be relevant to human congenital
      hydrocephalus, a birth defect that affects approximately 0.6 per 1000 newborns.

TI  - [The results of applying the system of neuronavigation in the intracranial
      surgery].
PG  - 16-9; discussion 19-20
AB  - Frameless stereotactic techniques combined with a high-resolution neuro-imaging
      made its possible for us to perform, with high reliability, interactive
      image-guided procedures. We used the Carl Zeiss Surgical Microscope Navigator
      System with Carl Zeiss OPMI NC-4 microscope. We reported our results on the first
      82 patients during the 20-month period. 36 were males (44%), 46--females (56%)
      with the age range of 15 to 79 (mean 43.43). The predominant diagnosis was tumor 
      (60 patients or 73.2%) with histological findings of astrocytoma and metastasis. 
      The surgical procedure was open microneurosurgery. There were no significant
      technical problems. The clinical and surgical results were satisfying in all
      cases. 14 patients with secondary epilepsy, as the only symptom, were
      postoperatively seizure-free. Neuronavigation cuts the time of surgery and
      ensures a more radical resection of pathological tissue with lower mortality and 
      morbidity thus improving the life quality of patients.

TI  - Pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.
PG  - 125-32
AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HIT/T) is a common
      immune-mediated disorder often manifested by life-threatening thrombosis. There
      is increasing evidence to indicate that HIT/T is caused by antibodies to
      complexes between platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin that activate platelets,
      monocytes and vascular endothelium leading to the generation of thrombin.
      Advances in defining the immunological basis of HIT/T have yielded insights into 
      the antigenic determinants, antibody-antigen interactions and effector responses 
      that contribute to its pathogenesis. However, these studies also reveal that
      anti-PF4/heparin antibodies develop far more commonly than clinically overt
      disease, raising questions as to serologic and other factors that predispose to
      clinical thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. An improved understanding of the
      natural history of HIT/T and the introduction of alternative anticoagulants have 
      led to a somewhat improved clinical outcome. The recent development of a
      monoclonal anti-heparin/PF4 antibody and the establishment of a murine model of
      HIT/T may help to better define the pathogenesis and management of this common
      autoimmune disorder.

TI  - Parental occupational exposure to pesticides and childhood brain cancer.
PG  - 989-97
AB  - The authors examined the risk of childhood brain cancer in relation to parental
      exposure to classes of pesticides among 154 children diagnosed with astrocytoma
      and 158 children diagnosed with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in the
      United States and Canada between 1986 and 1989. Controls were selected by random 
      digit dialing and were individually matched to cases by race, age, and geographic
      area. Each job in the fathers' work history and the usual occupation of mothers
      were assigned a probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure to
      insecticides, herbicides, and agricultural and nonagricultural fungicides.
      Elevated risks of astrocytoma were found for paternal exposure (ever vs. never)
      to all four classes of pesticides (odds ratio (OR) = 1.4-1.6). An increased risk 
      of PNET was observed for only herbicides (OR = 1.5). For mothers, odds ratios for
      astrocytoma were elevated for insecticides, herbicides, and nonagricultural
      fungicides (OR = 1.3-1.6) but not agricultural fungicides (OR = 1.0). No
      indication was found of an increased risk for PNET. There was little indication
      for an association with cumulative and average parental exposure. Most risk
      estimates were around unity, and exposure-response patterns were absent. Overall,
      it seems unlikely that parental exposure to pesticides plays an important role in
      the etiology of childhood brain cancer.

TI  - Locoregional radioimmunotherapy in selected patients with malignant glioma:
      experiences, side effects and survival times.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Prognosis of malignant glioma is very unfavourable mainly due to
      minimal tumour remnants in the peritumoural tissue. Intralesionally applied
      radioimmunotherapy is a possible therapeutical option with the potential to
      improve survival of patients with malignant glioma. We investigated side effects 
      and survival after surgery, conventional radiotherapy and additional
      radioimmunotherapy with labelled tenascin-antibodies in patients with malignant
      glioma. METHODS: Since 1995, 37 patients were treated with radioimmunotherapy
      after resection and radiotherapy of a malignant glioma. Patients received
      antibodies labelled with yttrium-90 and iodine-131 in different doses into the
      tumour cavity via a previously implanted ommaya-reservoir. Treatment was applied 
      in up to 8 cycles (mean 2.96 cycles) in time intervals of 6-8 weeks. Mean age was
      46 years, histology was anaplastic astrocytoma in 13 patients and glioblastoma in
      24 patients. RESULTS: For the whole group median survival time has not yet been
      reached. For glioblastoma the median survival time is 17 months, 5-year survival 
      probability for anaplastic astrocytoma is 85% approximately. Quality of life was 
      acceptable. Acute side effects following treatment were headache, seizures and
      worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms. Late side effects were skin
      necrosis and, in 1 case, a delayed aphasia probably due to a vascular lesion.
      CONCLUSION: Radioimmunotherapy prolonged survival time in a selected group of
      patients with malignant gliomas as compared to a historical control group.
      Patients with anaplastic astrocytomas seem to have more benefit from this therapy
      than patients with glioblastomas.

TI  - Thymus transplantation in complete DiGeorge syndrome: immunologic and safety
      evaluations in 12 patients.
PG  - 1121-30
AB  - Complete DiGeorge syndrome is a fatal condition in which infants have no
      detectable thymus function. The optimal treatment for the immune deficiency of
      complete DiGeorge syndrome has not been determined. Safety and efficacy of thymus
      transplantation were evaluated in 12 infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome who 
      had less than 20-fold proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin. All but one 
      had fewer than 50 T cells/mm3. Allogeneic postnatal cultured thymus tissue was
      transplanted. T-cell development was followed by flow cytometry, lymphocyte
      proliferation assays, and T-cell receptor Vbeta (TCRBV) repertoire evaluation. Of
      the 12 patients, 7 are at home 15 months to 8.5 years after transplantation. All 
      7 survivors developed T-cell proliferative responses to mitogens of more than 100
      000 counts per minute (cpm). By one year after transplantation, 6 of 7 patients
      developed antigen-specific proliferative responses. The TCRBV repertoire showed
      initial oligoclonality that progressed to polyclonality within a year. B-cell
      function developed in all 3 patients tested after 2 years. Deaths were associated
      with underlying congenital problems. Risk factors for death included
      tracheostomy, long-term mechanical ventilation, and cytomegalovirus infection.
      Adverse events in the first 3 months after transplantation included eosinophilia,
      rash, lymphadenopathy, development of CD4-CD8- peripheral T cells, elevated serum
      immunoglobulin E (IgE), and possible pulmonary inflammation. Adverse events
      related to the immune system occurring more than 3 months after transplantation
      included thrombocytopenia in one patient and hypothyroidism and alopecia in one
      other patient. Thymic transplantation is efficacious, well tolerated, and should 
      be considered as treatment for infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome.

TI  - The role of third ventriculostomy in the management of obstructive hydrocephalus.
PG  - 16-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an effective treatment for
      occlusive hydrocephalus caused by an obstruction of the CSF flow in the aqueduct 
      or the posterior fossa. We evaluated the factors age, pathology and surgical
      technique on the results of the ETV. METHODS: Between November 1992 and October
      2000 171 ETV have been performed in 159 patients. The follow-up was evaluated in 
      150 patients. The age ranged from 10 days to 77 years (mean age 35 years). The
      hydrocephalus was caused by benign aqueductal stenosis in 77 patients,
      space-occupying lesions in 59, by intraventricular hemorrhages in 11, and by
      other causes in 3 patients. The trajectory was planned in 31 patients by
      frame-based and in 4 patients by frameless stereotaxy. RESULTS: The overall
      success rate of a single ETV was 71.3 % and including successful re-ETV 76.7 %.
      Best results were observed in adults and children older than 1 year. Infants
      demonstrated significantly worser outcomes. Patients with benign aqueductal
      stenosis and tumor compressing the aqueduct had the greatest profit from the ETV.
      The stereotactic guidance had no influence on the outcome and the number of
      severe complications. Complications were one arterial bleeding, three venous
      bleedings, and one ICB, all without permanent deficit, except one permanent
      hemiparesis. No mortality was observed.

      unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the
      fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis
      of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of
      women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the
      diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The
      spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment
      approaches are addressed.

TI  - Successful aqueductal plasty and stenting for tectal plate tumor after failed
      third ventriculostomy: a case report.
PG  - 58-61; discussion 61-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tectal region tumors can lead to hydrocephalus secondary to
      aqueductal compression. Surgical options for these patients include extracranial 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts, third ventriculostomy, and/or aqueductal
      plasty. In cases of third ventriculostomy failure, the accepted alternative is an
      extracranial CSF shunt. We report a patient in whom a repeat third
      ventriculostomy with aqueductal plasty and stenting was successful after a failed
      initial third ventriculostomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old patient with
      hydrocephalus secondary to a tectal tumor presented with headaches and blurry
      vision. She had no focal neurologic findings. She underwent a third
      ventriculostomy. Five months after the procedure she had recurrence of her
      symptoms. Therefore, she underwent a secondary third ventriculostomy with
      aqueductal plasty and stenting. She has been symptom-free for 1 year. CONCLUSION:
      Aqueductal plasty with stenting may be an alternative to CSF shunts in some
      patients with hydrocephalus because of aqueductal compression resulting from
      tectal tumors.

TI  - Prospective study of neuropsychologic testing and quality-of-life assessment of
      adults with primary malignant brain tumors.
PG  - 992-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the characteristics of adult patients with newly diagnosed
      primary brain tumors associated with identifiable deficits in neuropsychologic
      function to target interventions to improve function and quality of life (QOL).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed primary brain tumors
      and their caregivers were enrolled and underwent a battery of standardized
      neuropsychologic tests, allowing for qualitative and quantitative assessment and 
      sensitive to the effects of the brain tumor, QOL, or caregiver stress. RESULTS:
      We enrolled 68 patients with no prior radiotherapy. Patients with left hemisphere
      tumors reported significantly more memory problems and depressive symptoms. They 
      also exhibited poorer attention and were more distractible, with poorer verbal
      fluency and poorer verbal learning. Patients with glioblastoma multiforme
      demonstrated poorer psychomotor speed and visual tracking than patients with
      non-glioblastoma multiforme histologic features. Patients and caregivers
      perceived QOL in a similar fashion, with significant correlation between patient 
      and caregiver on hope testing and general QOL on the Linear Analog
      Self-Assessment Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with left hemisphere tumors and
      glioblastoma multiforme histologic features demonstrated testable differences in 
      neuropsychologic function and QOL that may be amenable to improvement with
      medical therapy or tailored rehabilitation programs. Caregiver assessments can
      predict patient QOL, which may be useful in patients with declining status.

TI  - DAB389EGF fusion protein therapy of refractory glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 39-49
AB  - Primary brain tumors including anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma
      multiforme are difficult to treat because of their locally invasive nature and
      chemoradioresistance. Novel therapies are needed. One class of therapeutics is
      fusion proteins consisting of peptide toxins fused to brain tumor selective
      ligands. DAB389EGF is a fusion protein composed of the catalytic and
      translocation domains of diphtheria toxin fused via a His-Ala linker to human
      epidermal growth factor (EGF). DAB389EGF is selectively toxic to EGF receptor
      (EGFR) overexpressing cells. Close to half of all high-grade primary brain tumors
      have EGFR gene amplification and EGFR overexpression. With the use of
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED), DAB389EGF may be delivered locally at high
      concentrations to the brain tumor. CED would avoid many of the pharmacologic and 
      toxicologic barriers which have limited effective use of this agent including
      rapid clearance from the circulation, high anti-diphtheria toxin antibody titers 
      in the blood and toxicities to the liver and kidney. Both cell lines and animal
      models are available to assess the potential of this agent for brain tumor
      therapy. Since significant amounts of clinical grade DAB389EGF are available,
      some careful additional preclinical efficacy work should lead to testing of this 
      agent in patients within the next few years.

TI  - [Growth inhibition of epidermal growth factor-stimulated human glioblastoma cells
      by nicardipine in vito].
PG  - 211-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the growth effects of epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and the
      calcium channel antagonist nicardipine (NC) on U251 MG, a human malignant glioma 
      cell lime, which has high-affinity EGF receptors. METHODS: The growth effects of 
      EGF and NC on U251 MG cultured in serum-free and serum-containing (10% fetal
      bovine serum, FBS) media respectively were observed by MTT colorimeritric
      analysis. RESULTS: (1) EGF significantly enhanced the growth of U251 MG in a
      dose-dependent manner in serum-free conditions. The near-maximal effect was
      obtained at 10 mg.ml-1. The addition of serum obscured this effect. (2) NC
      decreased U251 MG cells proliferation, especially in serum-containing media, and 
      completely blocked the growth-stimulated effect of EGF. The combinated effects of
      EGF (10 ng.ml-1) and NC equaled those of NC alone. CONCLUSIONS: When serum is
      absent U251 MG cells showed a pronounced mitogenic response to EGF in a
      dosedependent manner, which approximated that achieved with 10% FBS. NC
      suppressed the growth of U251 MG cells and completely blocked the
      growth-stimulated effects of EGF, it can be used as an adjuvent therapy for human
      malignant gliomas.

TI  - Asymmetry of DNA replication and translesion synthesis of UV-induced thymine
      dimers.
PG  - 91-106
AB  - In vitro replication assays for detection and quantification of bypass of
      UV-induced DNA photoproducts were used to compare the capacity of extracts
      prepared from different human cell lines to replicate past the cis,syn
      cyclobutane thymine dimer ([c,s]TT). The results demonstrated that neither
      nucleotide excision repair (NER) nor mismatch repair (MMR) activities in the
      intact cells interfered with measurements of bypass replication efficiencies in
      vitro. Extracts prepared from HeLa (NER- and MMR-proficient), xeroderma
      pigmentosum group A (NER-deficient), and HCT116 (MMR-deficient) cells displayed
      similar capacity for translesion synthesis, when the substrate carried the
      site-specific [c,s]TT on the template for the leading or the lagging strand of
      nascent DNA. Extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells, which lack DNA
      polymerase eta, were devoid of bypass activity. Bypass-proficient extracts as a
      group (n=16 for 3 extracts) displayed higher efficiency (P=0.005) for replication
      past the [c,s]TT during leading strand synthesis (84+/-22%) than during lagging
      strand synthesis (64+/-13%). These findings are compared to previous results
      concerning the bypass of the (6-4) photoproduct [Biochemistry 40 (2001) 15215]
      and analyzed in the context of the reported characteristics of bypass DNA
      polymerases implicated in translesion synthesis of UV-induced DNA lesions. Models
      to explain how these enzymes might interact with the DNA replication machinery
      are considered. An alternative pathway of bypass replication, which avoids
      translesion synthesis, and the mutagenic potential of post-replication repair
      mechanisms that contribute to the duplication of the human genome damaged by UV
      are discussed.

TI  - Vascular targeted endoradiotherapy of tumors using alpha-particle-emitting
      compounds: theoretical analysis.
PG  - 1259-75
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish the theoretical framework and study the feasibility of
      (211)At-labeled anti-tenascin chimeric 81C6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as
      anti-vascular endoradiotherapy for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
      tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The morphology of blood vessels from histologic
      images was analyzed and used along with reaction-diffusion equations to assess
      the activity concentration of (211)At-labeled chimeric 81C6 mAb in GBM tumor and 
      normal-brain tissue. Alpha particle microdosimetry was then used to assess the
      survival probability and average absorbed dose for tumor and normal tissue
      endothelial cells (ECs) per unit vascular cumulated activity concentration
      q(source) (MBq-s g(-1)). In turn, these survival probabilities were used to
      assess the probability of failure Phi for a single vessel. Furthermore, using the
      vessel density, the specific tumor control probability per unit mass of tumor
      tissue (tcp) and the specific normal-tissue complication probability per unit
      mass of normal-brain tissue (ntcp) were estimated. The specific tumor control
      probability, tcp, was used to assess the overall tumor control probability (TCP) 
      as a function of tumor mass. RESULTS: The levels of (211)At-labeled ch81C6 mAb
      cumulated activity concentration in GBM tumor tissue were approximately five
      times higher than that in normal-brain tissue. Thus, the average absorbed dose to
      tumor ECs was higher than that of normal tissue ECs, and the survival probability
      for GBM ECs was lower than for normal-brain tissue ECs. Consequently, the
      resulting vessel-failure probability, Phi, for GBM tumor and for normal-brain
      tissue differ considerably, yielding a q(source) range between 10(3) and 10(4)
      MBq-s g(-1). CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical analysis demonstrated that
      (211)At-labeled chimeric 81C6 is an effective anti-vascular therapy for the
      treatment of GBM tumors, yielding a tcp higher than 0.999 for vascular cumulated 
      activity concentrations q(source) higher than 1 x 10(4) MBq-s g(-1), while
      yielding a low probability for normal-brain tissue damage.

TI  - Primary myelomeningocele closure and consequences.
PG  - 465-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Myelomeningocele, the most frequently occurring open neural
      tube defect, requires lifelong care of the patient by medical professionals and
      by relatives. A basic understanding of the neurosurgical measures that have to be
      taken in the newborn, the infant, the child and the adult is important also for
      physicians of other disciplines involved in the treatment of patients with
      myelomeningocele. RECENT FINDINGS: The most recent topic broadly discussed in
      this context is the role of foetal neurosurgery for closure of the neural tube
      defect. There is ongoing debate as to whether the beneficial postnatal effects of
      a prenatal operation in the unborn foetus outweighs the possible complications
      for the mother as well as the child. SUMMARY: As some of the problems associated 
      with myelomeningocele occur only later in life, it will still take many years
      until the beneficial, as well as the adverse, effects of prenatal neurosurgical
      procedures can be evaluated.

TI  - Recurrent malignant glioma in adults.
PG  - 509-24
AB  - Meaningful palliation is possible for selected patients with recurrent malignant 
      glioma (glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma, or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma) using aggressive
      treatment. Although long-term disease-free survival occurs in fewer than 10% of
      patients, most who achieve such survival have been treated for multiple
      recurrences. Surgical resection with the placement of lomustine-releasing wafers 
      is the only therapy proven in randomized trials to be beneficial for recurrent
      malignant gliomas. Reoperation is indicated when local mass effect limits the
      quality of life. Reoperation may make other treatments more effective by removing
      treatment-resistant hypoxic cells and thereby prolonging high-quality survival.
      Combination chemotherapy (including procarbazine and a nitrosourea) provides
      dramatic benefit for many recurrent anaplastic or aggressively behaving
      oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytomas. For other recurrent
      malignant gliomas, single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg, intravenous lomustine
      or platinums, oral carmustine, temozolomide, or procarbazine) appears to provide 
      equivalent results and better quality of life at a lower cost than do the
      combinations of cytotoxic drugs. A randomized phase II trial demonstrates that
      temozolomide provides longer progression-free survival and better quality of life
      than standard-dose procarbazine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. Because benefits of available cytotoxic chemotherapy for anaplastic
      astrocytoma and glioblastoma are small, participation in clinical trials is
      appropriate for most patients. Reirradiation (using stereotactic or
      three-dimensional conformal techniques with or without concomitant cytotoxic
      chemotherapy) as radiation sensitization can prolong high-quality survival in
      selected patients. Specific examples include radiosurgery with the gamma knife or
      with linear accelerators, intracavitary radiation with the newly US Food and Drug
      Administration-approved GliaSite (Proxima Therapeutics, Alpharetta, GA) radiation
      therapy system, low dose rate permanent-seed brachytherapy, and high dose rate
      stereotactic brachytherapy. Dexamethasone (used for the shortest time in the
      lowest effective doses) can provide symptomatic benefits. Osmotic diuretics such 
      as mannitol reduce cytotoxic edema more rapidly.

TI  - Re-ventriculostomy for treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in cases of stoma
      dysfunction.
PG  - 158-63
AB  - In this article, 12 re-ventriculostomies in the treatment for obstructive
      hydrocephalus are described. The etiology of the hydrocephalus was a benign
      aqueductal stenosis in 9 patients, a tumor around the aqueduct in 2 patients and 
      intraventricular bleeding in one patient. In all cases the initial
      ventriculostomy was successful, but after a time interval of 2 weeks to 6 years
      the patients developed similar clinical symptoms as preoperatively. In all except
      one case the radiological findings spoke in favour of stoma closure.
      Intraoperatively the stoma was completely closed in 9 patients and in 3 patients 
      a subtotal closure was observed. In all cases a re-ventriculostomy was performed 
      bluntly with a Fogarty catheter in loco typico at the floor of the third
      ventricle. Of the 12 patients 6 had an excellent outcome postoperatively, one
      patient improved and one had a benefit from the re-ventriculostomy although he
      died of cardiac problems. In the remaining 4 patients the re-ventriculostomy was 
      not successful and the patients needed a shunt operation. In conclusion, after
      initially successful endoscopic third ventriculostomy, re-ventriculostomy should 
      be considered as a sufficient treatment option in case of suspected stoma
      dysfunction.

TI  - ApoB-48 and apoB-100 differentially influence the expression of type-III
      hyperlipoproteinemia in APOE*2 mice.
PG  - 1520-8
AB  - Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is essential for the clearance of plasma chylomicron and 
      VLDL remnants. The human APOE locus is polymorphic and 5-10% of APOE*2
      homozygotes exhibit type-III hyperlipoproteinemia (THL), while the remaining
      homozygotes have less than normal plasma cholesterol. In contrast, mice
      expressing APOE*2 in place of the mouse Apoe (Apoe(2/2) mice) are markedly
      hyperlipoproteinemic, suggesting a species difference in lipid metabolism (e.g., 
      editing of apolipoprotein B) enhances THL development. Since apoB-100 has an LDLR
      binding site absent in apoB-48, we hypothesized that the Apoe(2/2) THL phenotype 
      would improve if all Apoe(2/2) VLDL contained apoB-100. To test this, we crossed 
      Apoe(2/2) mice with mice lacking the editing enzyme for apoB (Apobec(-/-)).
      Consistent with an increase in remnant clearance, Apoe(2/2). Apobec(-/-) mice
      have a significant reduction in IDL/LDL cholesterol (IDL/LDL-C) compared with
      Apoe(2/2) mice. However, Apoe(2/2).Apobec(-/-) mice have twice as much VLDL
      triglyceride as Apoe(2/2) mice. In vitro tests show the apoB-100-containing VLDL 
      are poorer substrates for lipoprotein lipase than apoB-48-containing VLDL. Thus, 
      despite a lowering in IDL/LDL-C, substituting apoB-48 lipoproteins with apoB-100 
      lipoproteins did not improve the THL phenotype in the Apoe(2/2).Apobec(-/-) mice,
      because apoB-48 and apoB-100 differentially influence the catabolism of
      lipoproteins.

TI  - Motifs within the CLN3 protein: modulation of cell growth rates and apoptosis.
PG  - 2129-42
AB  - Juvenile Batten disease (JNCL) is an autosomal recessive disease that results
      from mutations in the CLN3 gene. The wild-type CLN3 gene coding sequence has 15
      exons, and the translated protein consists of 438 amino acids. The most commonly 
      observed mutation is a 1.02 kb deletion in the genomic DNA. This deletion results
      in a truncated protein due to the loss of amino acids 154-438, and the
      introduction of 28 novel amino acids at the c-terminus. We demonstrate that,
      compared to normal controls, CLN3-deficient immortalization of lymphoblasts
      homozygous for this deletion grow at a slower rate, and show increased
      sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis, supporting the notion that CLN3 may
      negatively regulate apoptosis. Using immortalized JNCL lymphoblast cell lines as 
      a model system, we assess the effects of specific CLN3 mutations on cell growth
      rates and protection from etoposide-induced apoptosis. Protection from
      etoposide-induced apoptosis occurs and the cell growth rate is restored following
      transfection of JNCL lymphoblasts with mutant CLN3 cDNA that includes exons 11 or
      13. We show that deletion of the glycosylation sites 71NQSH74 and 310NTSL313, and
      also mutations within the highly conserved amino acid stretches
      184WSSGTGGAGLLG195, 291VYFAE295 and 330VFASRSSL337, result in slowed growth and
      susceptibility to apoptosis.

TI  - Pharmacology of INS37217 [P(1)-(uridine 5')-P(4)- (2'-deoxycytidine
      5')tetraphosphate, tetrasodium salt], a next-generation P2Y(2) receptor agonist
      for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
PG  - 871-80
AB  - INS37217 [P(1)-(uridine 5')-P(4)-(2'-deoxycytidine 5')tetraphosphate, tetrasodium
      salt] is a deoxycytidine-uridine dinucleotide with agonist activity at the P2Y(2)
      receptor. In primate lung tissues, the P2Y(2) receptor mRNA was located by in
      situ hybridization predominantly in epithelial cells and not in smooth muscle or 
      stromal tissue. The pharmacologic profile of INS37217 parallels that of UTP,
      leading to increased chloride and water secretion, increased cilia beat
      frequency, and increased mucin release. The combined effect of these actions was 
      confirmed in an animal model of tracheal mucus velocity that showed that a single
      administration of INS37217 significantly enhanced mucus transport for at least 8 
      h after dosing. This extended duration of action is consistent with the ability
      of INS37217 to resist metabolism by airway cells and sputum enzymes. The enhanced
      metabolic stability and resultant increased duration of improved mucociliary
      clearance may confer significant advantages to INS37217 over other P2Y(2)
      agonists in the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis.

TI  - 22q11 DS: genomic mechanisms and gene function in DiGeorge/velocardiofacial
      syndrome.
PG  - 407-19
AB  - 22q11 deletion syndrome (22qDS), also known as DiGeorge or velocardiofacial
      syndrome (DGS/VCFS), is a relatively common genetic anomaly that results in
      malformations of the heart, face and limbs. In addition, patients with 22qDS are 
      at significant risk for psychiatric disorders as well, with one in four
      developing schizophrenia, and one in six developing major depressive disorders.
      Like several other deletion syndromes associated with psychiatric or cognitive
      problems, it has been difficult to determine which of the specific genes in this 
      genomic region may mediate the syndrome. For example, patients with different
      genomic deletions within the 22q11 region have been found that have similar
      phenotypes, even though their deletions do not compromise the same set of genes. 
      In this review, we discuss the individual genes found in the region of 22q11 that
      is commonly deleted in 22qDS patients, and the potential roles each of these
      genes may play in the syndrome. Although many of these genes are interesting
      candidates by themselves, we hypothesize that the full spectrum of anomalies
      associated with 22qDS may result from the combined result of disruptions to
      numerous genes within the region that are involved in similar developmental or
      cellular processes.

TI  - Molecular markers of prognosis in astrocytic tumors.
PG  - 2688-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: Astrocytoma is a primary brain tumor that affects 20,000 Americans
      each year. To date, only age and histologic grade stand out as independent
      predictors of survival. There is now increased interest in the use of molecular
      markers as objective standards against which to establish diagnosis and grade.
      METHODS: The study evaluated human glioma tumor suppressor genes and associated
      loci in fresh snap-frozen gliomas from 63 males and 37 females, with a median age
      of 42 years, including 19 low-grade astrocytomas. The tumor samples were selected
      so that about equal numbers of glioblastomas from younger and older patients were
      represented in the series. Methods for suppressor gene and genetic loci
      evaluation included loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, multiplex polymerase
      chain reaction analysis, and gene sequencing. RESULTS: Low-grade astrocytomas had
      the least number of molecular abnormalities. LOH on 9p and/or CDKN2A deletion
      occurred more often in glioblastomas (P < 0.001), LOH on 17p/TP53 mutations
      occurred more frequently in anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs; P = 0.112), and LOH on 
      10q/PTEN mutation frequency was similar in glioblastomas and AAs (P < 0.001).
      Poorer survival was associated significantly with the occurrence of either
      deletion of p16 (P = 0.031), LOH on 9p (P = 0.016), or LOH on 10q (P = 0.0007).
      The absence of LOH on 17p and the presence of PTEN mutation were associated
      marginally with survival. Even though TP53 mutations were more frequent among
      younger patients with glioblastoma, they had no statistically significant effect 
      on survival after adjustment for age (P = 0.62). In all multivariate models, age 
      and grade were the only significant predictors of survival or were nearly
      significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that LOH on 
      9p and p16 deletions may prove to be objective standards for the diagnosis of
      patients with high-grade gliomas, although the absence of these abnormalities is 
      nonprognostic.

TI  - Lymphomas and high-grade astrocytomas: comparison of water diffusibility and
      histologic characteristics.
PG  - 177-83
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if water diffusivity within lymphomas and high-grade
      astrocytomas correlates with cellularity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echo-planar
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in 11 patients with
      brain lymphomas (19 lesions) and in 17 patients with astrocytomas (19 lesions)
      were retrospectively reviewed. Regions of interest were drawn on apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in enhancing tumor. ADC values were normalized
      by dividing ADC values of tumors by those of normal-appearing regions and
      expressing the quotient as a ratio. Histologic samples from 11 patients with
      astrocytomas (11 lesions) and seven patients with lymphoma (seven lesions) were
      reviewed. Cellularity was measured by calculating the percentage of nuclear area 
      and the percentage of cytoplasmic area and expressing the results as the
      nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. The ADC and N/C ratios of both tumor types
      were compared by using a two-tailed t test. RESULTS: Mean ADC ratio of lymphomas 
      was 1.15 (SD, 0.33; standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.10), and that of
      high-grade astrocytomas was 1.68 (SD, 0.48; SEM, 0.11) (P <.01). Mean N/C ratio
      of lymphoma was 1.45 (SD, 0.94; SEM, 0.36), and that of high-grade astrocytomas
      was 0.24 (SD, 0.18; SEM, 0.05) (P <.01). CONCLUSION: Measurements of water
      diffusivity and cellularity suggest that higher cellularity contributes to more
      restricted diffusion.

TI  - Multicentre phase II and pharmacokinetic study of RFS2000 (9-nitro-camptothecin) 
      administered orally 5 days a week in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 1348-50
AB  - A phase II trial was instigated to investigate the antitumour activity, the
      safety and the pharmacokinetic parameters of RFS2000, a recently identified oral 
      topoisomerase I inhibitor, given once daily (1.5 mg/m(2)/day) as first-line
      chemotherapy treatment for patients with advanced glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). 
      Between 9 March and 15 September 2000, 17 patients were entered onto the trial.
      15 patients were considered eligible. A total of 49 cycles (range 1-8) were
      administered. Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 5 patients. Neutropenia and
      thrombocytopenia were common toxicities. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that
      9-nitro camptothecin (9-NC) could be detected in the plasma and is progressively 
      converted into 9-amino-camptothecin (9-AC). The response rate was poor, with 5
      patients experiencing tumour stabilisation and 10 progressing. Thus, the results 
      do not support the further evaluation of RFS2000 as a single agent in patients
      with recurrent GBM.

TI  - Astrocyte inactivation of the pRb pathway predisposes mice to malignant
      astrocytoma development that is accelerated by PTEN mutation.
PG  - 157-68
AB  - We have inactivated pRb, p107, and p130 in astrocytes by transgenic expression of
      T(121) (a truncated SV40 T antigen) under the GFAP promoter. Founder mice died
      perinatally with extensive expansion of neural precursor and anaplastic astrocyte
      populations. In astrocytes, aberrant proliferation and extensive apoptosis were
      induced. Using a conditional allele of T(121), early lethality was circumvented, 
      and adult mice developed high-grade astrocytoma, in which regions of decreased
      apoptosis expressed activated Akt. Indeed, astrocytoma development was
      accelerated in a PTEN(+/-), but not p53(+/-), background. These studies establish
      a highly penetrant preclinical model for astrocytoma based on events observed in 
      the human disease and further provide insight into the role of PTEN mutation in
      astrocytoma progression.

TI  - DNA damage responses protect xeroderma pigmentosum variant from UVC-induced
      clastogenesis.
PG  - 959-65
AB  - Lack of DNA polymerase eta and the attendant defect in bypass replication of
      pyrimidine dimers induced in DNA by ultraviolet light (UV) underlie the enhanced 
      mutagenesis and carcinogenesis observed in xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V). 
      We investigated whether diploid XP-V fibroblasts growing in culture are also more
      susceptible to UV-induced clastogenesis than normal human fibroblasts (NHF). This
      study utilized diploid fibroblasts immortalized by the ectopic expression of
      human telomerase. The cell lines displayed checkpoint responses to DNA damage
      comparable with those measured in the parental strains. Shortly after exposure to
      low doses of UVC (< or =4 J/m2), XP-V cells accumulated daughter strand gaps in
      excess of normal controls (>25-fold). Daughter strand gaps generated in
      UV-irradiated S phase cells are potential precursors of chromatid-type
      chromosomal aberrations. Nonetheless, chromatid-type chromosomal aberrations were
      only 1.5 to 2 times more abundant in XP-V than in NHF exposed to the same UVC
      dose. XP-V cells, however, displayed S phase delays at lower doses of UVC and for
      longer periods of time than NHF. These results support the hypothesis that
      aberrant DNA structures activate S phase checkpoint responses that increase the
      time available for postreplication repair. Alternatively, cells that cannot be
      properly repaired remain permanently arrested and never reach mitosis. These
      responses protect human cells from chromosomal aberrations, especially when other
      pathways, such as accurate lesion bypass, are lost.

TI  - Evaluation of software for registration of contrast-enhanced brain MR images in
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated commercially available software that rapidly and
      automatically registers brain MR images on a clinical workstation, and we studied
      the accuracy of these registrations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with a
      diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme underwent contrast-enhanced inversion
      recovery prepared three-dimensional (3D) volumetric spoiled gradient-recalled
      acquisition in the steady state (SPGR) MR imaging (contiguous 1.5-mm slice
      thickness, 96-104 slices). After this imaging sequence, each patient was brought 
      out of the head coil into a sitting position and then repositioned in the coil.
      The inversion recovery prepared 3D SPGR sequence was then repeated. A
      commercially available software program operating on a clinical workstation was
      used to automatically register the second inversion recovery prepared SPGR series
      to the first. The speed of registration was recorded. The accuracy of each
      registration was estimated by recording the coordinates of eight anatomic
      landmarks on the registered and reference series and by calculating the mean
      error among matching landmarks. RESULTS: In nine of 10 patients, the registration
      software produced a visually satisfactory registration. In one patient, a second 
      registration was necessary to produce a satisfactory registration. The processing
      time for each iteration was 48.3 +/- 3.8 sec (mean +/- SD). The mean error in
      aligning matching anatomic landmarks ranged from 0.67 to 1.41 mm, with an overall
      mean of 1.18 mm. The largest error among matching landmarks was 2.3 mm.
      CONCLUSION: Commercially available registration software can automatically
      register 3D imaging volumes in less than 1 min. The mean error in registration
      was approximately equivalent to the dimensions of a single voxel.

TI  - Progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in native lungs after single lung
      transplantation.
PG  - 2072-6
AB  - This retrospective, single-center study was conducted to assess the response of
      native idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs to a potent cyclosporine-based
      immunosuppressive regimen in single-lung transplantation recipients. The study
      included IPF patients who had undergone single-lung transplantation and had chest
      CT scans before and after transplantation. Five patients underwent single-lung
      transplantation for IPF between April 1992 and January 2001, and met entry
      criteria. All patients were placed on an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of 
      prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. In two of the five patients, ground
      glass attenuation in the native IPF lung improved post-transplantation. However, 
      fibrotic changes progressed in all five patients. In patients with advanced IPF, 
      a potent cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen is not likely to have an
      effect on the progression of the disease.

TI  - Low-grade gliomas.
PG  - 495-506
AB  - Low-grade gliomas are uncommon primary brain tumors classified as histologic
      grades I or II in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The most
      common variants are pilocytic and low-grade astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and
      mixed oligo-astrocytomas located in the cerebral hemispheres. Prognostic factors 
      that predict progression-free and overall survival include young age, pilocytic
      histology, good Karnofsky performance status, gross total resection, lack of
      enhancement on imaging, and small preoperative tumor volumes. Edema and vasogenic
      effects are typically managed with corticosteroids. Dexamethasone is given at an 
      initial dosage of 4 mg given four times daily. Anticonvulsants are given
      prophylactically after resection and for patients who present with seizures. The 
      rationale for open craniotomy depends on the need for immediate palliation of
      symptoms by reduction of intracranial pressure or focal mass effect, and/or
      improved oncologic control. Gross total resection of tumor is generally defined
      as the absence of residual enhancement on contrast-enhanced postoperative MRI
      scan. Most retrospective studies suggest that patients who have undergone a gross
      total resection of tumor have improved survival. Depending upon the proximity of 
      the tumor to eloquent brain, gross total resection may or may not be possible. In
      these cases a stereotactic biopsy is required to provide the histologic
      diagnosis. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended for patients with incompletely
      resected grade II tumors or for patients older than age 40 regardless of extent
      of resection. It may be considered for any pilocytic astrocytoma from which a
      biopsy has been performed. Phase III randomized prospective trials have shown
      statistically significantly improved progression-free survival at 5 years with
      the addition of radiotherapy, though overall survival does not appear different. 
      Based on prospective randomized phase III trials, 50.4 Gy to 54 Gy of
      conventionally fractionated radiotherapy appears to be a safe and effective
      regimen with minimal neurotoxicity; 45 Gy may be adequate for biopsied pilocytic 
      astrocytomas. Currently, RTOG trial 98-02 is investigating the efficacy of
      postradiation PCV chemotherapy (procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine) in the
      treatment of newly diagnosed unfavorable low-grade gliomas. Other areas of
      investigation include Temozolomide chemotherapy and the association of 1p and 19q
      chromosomal deletions with prolonged survival in oligodendrogliomas and
      sensitivity to PCV chemotherapy. Radiosurgery and/or experimental chemotherapy
      may provide some measure of local control in the recurrent disease setting.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid shunt survival and etiology of failures: a seven-year
      institutional experience.
PG  - 248-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Innovations in shunt technology and neuroendoscopy have been
      increasingly applied to shunt management. However, the relative life span of
      shunts and the etiology of shunt failure have not been characterized recently.
      METHODS: We reviewed the records of all shunting procedures at our institution
      between January 1992 and December 1998. Independent predictors of shunt failure
      were analyzed via multivariate Cox regression analysis in 836 shunting
      procedures. Independent predictors of the etiology of failure (infection,
      proximal obstruction, distal malfunction) were analyzed via multivariate logistic
      regression analysis in the 383 shunts which failed. RESULTS: A total of 353
      pediatric patients underwent 308 shunt placements and 528 revisions. The risk
      (hazard ratio; HR) of shunt failure decreased as a function of time in both
      primary placements and revised shunts. In failed shunts, the odds of infection
      decreased 4-fold per year of shunt function, while the odds of distal malfunction
      increased 1.45-fold per year. Increasing number of shunt revisions (HR 1.31, p < 
      0.05), decreasing patient age in years (HR 1.04, p < 0.001), gestational age <40 
      weeks (HR 2.15, p < 0.001) but not the etiology of hydrocephalus were associated 
      with an increased risk of shunt failure. Revisions versus primary placements,
      Dandy-Walker cysts and gestational age <40 weeks were independently associated
      with proximal, distal and infectious causes of failure, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The long-term shunt revision rates observed here are similar to
      those reported over the past 2 decades. Shunt life span remains poorer in shunt
      revisions and in younger patients. Patient characteristics may suggest a specific
      risk and mechanism of failure, aiding in the long-term management of shunted
      hydrocephalus.

TI  - Ki-67 immunoreactivity, basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) expression, and
      microvessel density as supplementary prognostic tools in low-grade astrocytomas. 
      An immunohistochemical study with special reference to the reliability of
      different Ki-67 antibodies.
PG  - 261-5
AB  - Low-grade diffuse astrocytomas are generally slow-growing tumors; however, they
      may progress to anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastomas. As existing grading
      systems fail to distinguish these tumors, ongoing research strives to identify
      new prognostic markers. In this study, 22 adult patients with supratentorial
      diffuse astrocytomas, WHO grade II, were investigated to clarify whether
      proliferative activity, assessed by different Ki67 antibodies (MIB-1, NC-MM1,
      NC-Ki67p, rahKi67), expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or
      microvessel density have prognostic power. The Ki67 antibodies revealed low
      proliferation indices (PI); however, there was a wide spread of values, ranging
      from 0.1% to about 10%. In general, a positive correlation between the different 
      Ki67 PIs was found. In 12 of 22 cases, bFGF immunoreactivity was recorded.
      Microvessel density was generally low. MIB-1 PI was the only prognostic factor of
      statistical significance. Ki67 PI, obtained by using the monoclonal antibody
      MIB-1, can thus serve as a prognostic factor capable of identifying subsets of
      low-grade diffuse astrocytomas with a potentially more aggressive clinical
      behavior.

TI  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.
PG  - 111-116
AB  - We report two cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients with
      Graves' ophthalmopathy. These patients, with known Graves' ophthalmopathy,
      presented with new onset optic disc edema and preserved visual function. Moderate
      enlargement of the extraocular muscles was observed in one case and moderate
      expansion of the orbital fat volume was observed in the second case. Lumbar
      puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure and normal cerebrospinal fluid
      composition in both patients. Also, no intracranial abnormalities were seen with 
      neuroimaging studies. The findings in these patients suggest idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension as a second concurrent diagnosis, and should be
      considered as a possible etiology of optic disc edema in patients with
      Gravesthorn ophthalmopathy and preserved visual function.

TI  - Primary cellular immunodeficiencies.
PG  - 747-57
AB  - Genetic defects in T-cell function lead to susceptibility to infections or to
      other clinical problems that are more grave than those seen in disorders
      resulting in antibody deficiency alone. Those affected usually present during
      infancy with either common or opportunistic infections and rarely survive beyond 
      infancy or childhood. The spectrum of T-cell defects ranges from the syndrome of 
      severe combined immunodeficiency, in which T-cell function is absent, to combined
      immunodeficiency disorders in which there is some, but not adequate, T-cell
      function for a normal life span. Recent discoveries of the molecular causes of
      many of these defects have led to a new understanding of the flawed biology
      underlying the ever-growing number of defects. Most of these conditions could be 
      diagnosed by means of screening for lymphopenia or for T-cell deficiency in cord 
      blood at birth. Early recognition of those so afflicted is essential to the
      application of the most appropriate treatments for these conditions at a very
      early age. The latter treatments include both transplantation and gene therapy in
      addition to immunoglobulin replacement. Fully defining the molecular defects of
      such patients is also essential for genetic counseling of family members and
      prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Phase II trial of carmustine plus O(6)-benzylguanine for patients with
      nitrosourea-resistant recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.
PG  - 2277-83
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase II trial of carmustine (BCNU) plus the
      O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)-BG) to 
      define the activity and toxicity of this regimen in the treatment of adults with 
      progressive or recurrent malignant glioma resistant to nitrosoureas. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients were treated with O(6)-BG at an intravenous dose of 120 mg/m(2)
      followed 1 hour later by 40 mg/m(2) of BCNU, with cycles repeated at 6-week
      intervals. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (15 with glioblastoma
      multiforme, two with anaplastic astrocytoma, and one with malignant glioma). None
      of the 18 patients demonstrated a partial or complete response. Two patients
      exhibited stable disease for 12 weeks before their tumors progressed. Three
      patients demonstrated stable disease for 6, 12, and 18 weeks before discontinuing
      therapy because of hematopoietic toxicity. Twelve patients experienced reversible
      > or = grade 3 hematopoietic toxicity. There was no difference in half-lives
      (0.56 +/- 0.21 hour v 0.54 +/- 0.20 hour) or area under the curve values (4.8 +/-
      1.7 microg/mL/h v 5.0 +/- 1.3 microg/mL/h) of O(6)-BG for patients receiving
      phenytoin and those not treated with this drug. CONCLUSION: These results
      indicate that O(6)-BG plus BCNU at the dose schedule used in this trial is
      unsuccessful in producing tumor regression in patients with nitrosourea-resistant
      malignant glioma, although stable disease was seen in five patients for 6, 12,
      12, 12, and 18 weeks. Future use of this approach will require strategies to
      minimize dose-limiting toxicity of BCNU such as regional delivery or
      hematopoietic stem-cell protection.

TI  - 2-Chloro N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate is a
      selective high affinity P2Y(1) receptor antagonist.
PG  - 2004-10
AB  - 1. We reported previously that bisphosphate derivatives of adenosine are
      antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor and that modification of the ribose in these
      analogues is tolerated in the P2Y(1) receptor binding pharmacophore. 2. Here we
      delineate the pharmacological activity of one such non-nucleotide molecule,
      2-chloro N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate
      (MRS2279), in which the ribose is replaced by a cyclopentane ring constrained in 
      the (N)-conformation by a cyclopropane moiety. 3. MRS2279 antagonized
      2MeSADP-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in turkey erythrocyte membranes
      with competitive kinetics (pK(B)=7.75). High affinity competitive antagonism by
      MRS2279 was also observed at the human P2Y(1) receptor (pK(B)=8.10) stably
      expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. Antagonism was specific for the
      P2Y(1) receptor since MRS2279 had no effect on activation of the human P2Y(2),
      P2Y(4), P2Y(6), or P2Y(11) receptors by their cognate agonists. 4. MRS2279 also
      did not block the capacity of ADP to act through the Gi/adenylyl cyclase linked
      P2Y receptor of platelets to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation. 5. In contrast, the
      P2Y(1) receptor is known to be obligatory in the process of ADP-induced platelet 
      aggregation, and MRS2279 competitively inhibited ADP-promoted platelet
      aggregation with an apparent affinity (pK(B)=8.05) similar to that observed at
      the human P2Y(1) receptor heterologously expressed in 1321N1 cells. 6. Taken
      together these results illustrate selective high affinity antagonism of the
      P2Y(1) receptor by a non-nucleotide molecule that should prove useful for
      pharmacological delineation of this receptor in various tissues.

TI  - Microarray studies of gene expression in circulating leukocytes in kidney
      diseases.
PG  - 139-49
AB  - The molecular characterization of changes in mRNA expression in renal tissue
      during disease is hampered by the acquisition of sufficient mRNA to do genomewide
      expression profiling. In many renal diseases, such as systemic lupus
      erythematosus, IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)
      associated glomerulonephritis, and small-vessel vasculitis (ANCA disease),
      circulating leukocytes play a role in onset, progression, and severity of the
      condition. Circulating leukocytes are readily isolated and supply sufficient mRNA
      for analysis, allowing molecular investigation into their involvement in the
      disease process. Our laboratory has undertaken a systematic study of the
      genomewide expression profiles of the circulating leukocytes from patients with a
      variety of renal diseases (ANCA disease, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, focal 
      segmental glomerulosclerosis), using the Affymetrix high-density gene chip array 
      technology. Analysis of the data showed clustering of expressed genes unique for 
      each individual disease group. These results imply that significant gene
      expression changes occur in leukocytes that are circulating in patients with
      renal diseases. In addition, gene expression has been studied in leukocytes
      activated in vitro by mechanisms that mimic pathogenic events in vivo. The
      expression levels of genes identified in in vitro studies were compared with the 
      patient leukocyte gene expression to determine whether similar pathological
      events were occurring in vivo.

TI  - Flupirtine blocks apoptosis in batten patient lymphoblasts and in human
      postmitotic CLN3- and CLN2-deficient neurons.
PG  - 448-66
AB  - Multiple gene defects cause Batten disease. Accelerated apoptosis accounts for
      neurodegeneration in the late infantile and juvenile forms that are due to
      defects in the CLN3 and CLN2 genes. Extensive neuronal death is seen in CLN2- and
      CLN3-deficient human brain as well as in CLN6-deficient sheep brain and retina.
      When neurons in late infantile and juvenile brain survive, they manage to do so
      by upregulating the neuroprotective molecule Bcl-2. The CLN3 gene has
      antiapoptotic properties at the molecular level. We show that the CLN2 gene is
      neuroprotective: it enhances growth of NT2 cells and maintains survival of human 
      postmitotic hNT neurons. Conversely, blocking CLN3 or CLN2 expression in hNT
      neurons with adenoviral antisense-CLN3 or antisense-CLN2-AAV2 constructs causes
      apoptosis. The drug flupirtine is a triaminopyridine derivative that acts as a
      nonopioid analgesic. Flupirtine upregulates Bcl-2, increases glutathione levels, 
      activates an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and delays loss of
      intermitochondrial membrane calcium retention capacity. We show that flupirtine
      aborts etoposide-induced apoptosis in CLN1-, CLN2-, CLN3-, and CLN6-deficient as 
      well as normal lymphoblasts. Flupirtine also prevents the death of CLN3- and
      CLN2-deficient postmitotic hNT neurons at the mitochondrial level. We show that a
      mechanism of neuroprotection exerted by flupirtine involves complete functional
      antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate or N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neuronal
      apoptosis. Flupirtine may be useful as a drug capable of halting the progression 
      of neurodegenerative diseases caused by dysregulated apoptosis.

TI  - Phase II study of irinotecan (CPT-11) in children with high-risk malignant brain 
      tumors: the Duke experience.
PG  - 102-8
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/4.2.109 [doi]
AB  - A phase II study of irinotecan (CPT-11) was conducted at Duke University Medical 
      Center, Durham, NC, to evaluate the activity of this agent in children with
      high-risk malignant brain tumors. A total of 22 children were enrolled in this
      study, including 13 with histologically verified recurrent malignant brain tumors
      (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM] 4, anaplastic astrocytoma 1, ependymoma 5, and
      medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor 3), 5 with recurrent diffuse
      pontine glioma, and 4 with newly diagnosed GBM. All patients with recurrent tumor
      had prior chemotherapy and/or irradiation. Each course of CPT-11 consisted of 125
      mg/m ( 2 ) per week given i.v. for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period.
      Patients with recurrent tumors received therapy until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with newly diagnosed tumors initially received 3 
      cycles of treatment to assess tumor response and then were allowed radiotherapy
      at physician's choice; patients who demonstrated a response to CPT-11 prior to
      radiotherapy were allowed to continue the drug after radiation until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. A 25% to 50% dose reduction was made for
      grade III-IV toxicity. Responses were assessed after every course by
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and spine. Twenty-two patients received a
      median of 2 courses of CPT-11 (range, 1-16). Responses were seen in 4 of 9
      patients with GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma (44%; 95% confidence interval,
      11%-82%) (complete response in 2 patients with recurrent GBM lasting 9 months and
      48+ months; partial response in one patient with a newly diagnosed midbrain GBM
      lasting 18 months prior to radiotherapy; and partial response lasting 11 months
      in 1 patient with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma), 1 of 5 patients with
      recurrent ependymoma (partial response initially followed by stable disease
      lasting 11 months), and none of 5 patients with recurrent diffuse pontine glioma.
      Two of 3 patients with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor had stable
      disease for 9 and 13 months. Toxicity was mainly myelosuppression, with 12 of 22 
      patients (50%) suffering grade II-IV neutropenia. Seven patients required dose
      reduction secondary to neutropenia. CPT-11, given in this schedule, appears to be
      active in children with malignant glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma with
      acceptable toxicity. Ongoing studies will demonstrate if activity of CPT-11 can
      be enhanced when combined with alkylating agents, including carmustine and
      temozolomide.

TI  - Clinical management of adult ITP prior to splenectomy: a perspective.
PG  - 47-9
AB  - A philosophy of management of adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) prior
      to splenectomy is presented. The initial action is to determine whether the
      condition is hyperacute, acute, or chronic. In symptomatic cases, initial
      remission usually requires steroids and the administration of intravenous
      immunoglobulin (i.v.Ig), followed by platelet transfusion if the patient is
      actively hemorrhaging. Once initial remission is achieved, a rapid reduction to
      minimal maintenance therapy should be made. The options include steroids,
      immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Adjustments to maintenance therapy must be made 
      with the understanding that response rates vary for each agent.

TI  - Phase II trial of murine (131)I-labeled antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6
      administered into surgically created resection cavities of patients with newly
      diagnosed malignant gliomas.
PG  - 1389-97
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of intraresection cavity
      (131)I-labeled murine antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 and determine its
      true response rate among patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: In this phase II trial, 120 mCi of (131)I-labeled murine 81C6 was
      injected directly into the surgically created resection cavity of 33 patients
      with previously untreated malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM], n =
      27; anaplastic astrocytoma, n = 4; anaplastic oligodendroglioma, n = 2). Patients
      then received conventional external-beam radiotherapy followed by a year of
      alkylator-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival for all patients and those
      with GBM was 86.7 and 79.4 weeks, respectively. Eleven patients remain alive at a
      median follow-up of 93 weeks (range, 49 to 220 weeks). Nine patients (27%)
      developed reversible hematologic toxicity, and histologically confirmed,
      treatment-related neurologic toxicity occurred in five patients (15%). One
      patient (3%) required reoperation for radionecrosis. CONCLUSION: Median survival 
      achieved with (131)I-labeled 81C6 exceeds that of historical controls treated
      with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, even after accounting for
      established prognostic factors including age and Karnofsky performance status.
      The median survival achieved with (131)I-labeled 81C6 compares favorably with
      either (125)I interstitial brachy-therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery and is
      associated with a significantly lower rate of reoperation for radionecrosis. Our 
      results confirm the efficacy of (131)I-labeled 81C6 for patients with newly
      diagnosed malignant glioma and suggest that a randomized phase III study is
      indicated.

TI  - Outcome of lung transplantation in patients with mycetomas.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation has become an acceptable treatment option for
      many end-stage lung diseases. Pulmonary mycetomas are found in patients with
      end-stage lung diseases, especially sarcoidosis. The clinical course and
      long-term outcome of these patients after transplantation remains unknown.
      METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the pathology reports of the explanted lungs
      from all lung and heart-lung transplantations performed at our institution
      between January 20, 1992, and June 26, 2000. Patients were included in our study 
      if mycetomas were present on the specimens. Information on transplant date and
      type, diagnosis, information on antifungal therapy and fungal infections
      pretransplant and posttransplant, and clinical course after transplantation was
      recorded. RESULTS: Mycetomas were present in 3.0% of transplant recipients (9 of 
      303 patients). The underlying pulmonary diagnoses were sarcoidosis (six
      patients), and emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumoconiosis (one 
      patient each). Seven patients received bilateral lung transplants, one patient
      received a heart/lung transplant, and one patient received a single lung
      transplant. Aspergillus was isolated from culture in five patients pretransplant 
      and from five patients posttransplant. Six patients received treatment with
      itraconazole, or IV or inhaled amphotericin B prior to transplantation. All
      patients who survived transplantation received posttransplant antifungal therapy.
      Four patients died in the first month after transplantation. Two patients died at
      17 months and 24 months posttransplant, respectively; one patient received a
      second transplant 30 months later; and two patients are alive and free from
      fungal infections 17 months and 18 months, respectively, after transplantation.
      All of the medium-term survivors received lengthy therapy with inhaled and
      systemic amphotericin B and itraconazole before and after transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant recipients with mycetomas have significantly reduced
      posttransplant survival. Careful selection of patients and aggressive antifungal 
      therapies before and after transplantation have led to improved outcomes in
      patients with mycetomas. Additional research is needed to define the best
      therapeutic strategy for these patients during transplantation.

TI  - Activity of irofulven (6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene) in the treatment of
      glioblastoma multiforme-derived xenografts in athymic mice.
PG  - 413-6
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to define the activity of irofulven in the
      treatment of a series of xenografts derived from human glioblastoma multiforme
      growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. METHODS: Athymic 
      mice bearing subcutaneous or intracranial tumors were treated with irofulven at a
      10% lethal dose with responses compared to tumor-bearing mice treated with drug
      vehicle. RESULTS: Irofulven was active against all tumor lines tested with growth
      delays ranging from 5.6 to 81.6 days (all values statistically significant, P <
      or = 0.001). Irofulven also produced a statistically significant (P < or = 0.001)
      increase in the median survival of mice bearing D-456 intracranial xenografts
      with a 162% increase in median survival. CONCLUSIONS: Irofulven is active in a
      spectrum of human glioblastoma multiforme-derived xenografts and evaluation in
      patients with this neoplasm is warranted.

      [6-N-(1-hydroxymethyla-2-hydroxyl)
      ethylamino-12,13-dihydro-13-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)
      -5H-indolo[2,3-a]-pyrrolo[3,4-c]-carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione]] against pediatric and 
      adult central nervous system tumor xenografts.
PG  - 250-4
AB  - PURPOSE: The in vivo antitumor activity of a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor,
      J-107088, was tested in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous or intracranial
      pediatric and adult malignant CNS tumor-derived xenografts. METHODS: J-107088 was
      administered to animals on days 1-5 and 8-12 via intraperitoneal injection at a
      dose of 54 mg/kg (162 mg/m2) per day in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in 0.9% saline.
      The xenografts evaluated were derived from a childhood glioblastoma multiforme
      (D-456 MG), a childhood medulloblastoma (D-341 MED), an adult anaplastic
      astrocytoma (D-54 MG), an adult glioblastoma multiforme (D-245 MG), and a
      procarbazine-resistant subline of D-245 MG [D-245 MG (PR)]. RESULTS: J-107088
      produced regressions and significant growth inhibition in all five of the
      xenograft lines growing subcutaneously. Growth delays ranged from 7.6 days with
      D-245 MG to 62.1 days with D-456 MG (P < 0.001). J-107088 also produced an 83%
      increase in survival in mice bearing intracranial D-456 MG (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: These results indicate that J-107088 may be active in the treatment
      of childhood and adult malignant brain tumors and provide the rationale for
      initiation of clinical trials with this agent.

TI  - Phase I study of Gliadel wafers plus temozolomide in adults with recurrent
      supratentorial high-grade gliomas.
PG  - 246-50
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/3.4.246 [doi]
AB  - Both Gliadel wafers [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea] and temozolomide
      (TEMO) have been shown in independent studies to prolong survival of patients
      with recurrent malignant glioma following surgery and radiotherapy. On the basis 
      of preclinical evidence of synergism between Gliadel wafers and TEMO, a phase I
      study was designed to evaluate the toxicity of combining these 2 agents in the
      treatment of patients with recurrent supratentorial malignant glioma. All
      patients had surgical resection of the tumor at relapse, and up to 8 Gliadel
      (3.85%) wafers were placed in the surgical cavity following resection. Two weeks 
      after surgery, TEMO was given orally daily for 5 days. Cohorts of 3 patients
      received TEMO at daily doses of 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2,
      respectively. Patients were assessed for toxicity 4 weeks after start of the
      first course of TEMO. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was used to assesstumor 
      response after the first cycle of TEMO. Patients with stable disease or response 
      after the first cycle of TEMO were allowed to continue treatment at the same dose
      every 4 weeks for 12 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Ten patients with a median age of 47 years (range, 22-66 years) were
      enrolled in this study. There were 7 patients with glioblastoma multiforme and 3 
      patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. Three patients were treated with TEMO at
      the first dose level of 100 mg/m2, 4 at the second dose level of 150 mg/m2, and 3
      at the third dose level of 200 mg/m2. The 10 patients received a median of 3
      cycles (range, 1-12 cycles) of TEMO following placement of Gliadel wafers. The
      treatment was well tolerated, with only 1 patient suffering grade III
      thrombocytopenia at the highest dose level. Two patients at each dose level had
      no evidence of disease progression after treatment. Four patients suffered
      progressive disease on therapy. Our study demonstrates that TEMO can be given
      safely after placement of Gliadel (3.85%) wafers. The recommended dosage for TEMO
      for a phase II study of this combination is 200 mg/m2 per day for 5 days.

LID - 10.1093/neuonc/1.1.52 [doi]
AB  - Morphologic criteria for diagnosing oligodendrogliomas and for classifying them
      as well-differentiated (World Health Organization grade II) and anaplastic (World
      Health Organization grade III) are well recognized. Nevertheless, applying these 
      guidelines to specific cases often reveals discrepancies among different
      observers. In addition, whether a given tumor also contains an astrocytic
      component may be debatable. Loss of heterozygosity studies have demonstrated that
      oligodendroglial neoplasms have a high incidence of loss of the 1p and 19q
      chromosomal arms. Although loss of heterozygosity for portions of 19q are
      sometimes seen in astrocytic neoplasms, these tumors seldom show complete loss of
      19q accompanied by loss of 1p. Loss of 9p or homozygous deletion of the CDKN2
      gene or both are associated with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, whereas loss of
      17p or TP53 gene mutations or both are frequent in astrocytomas, but rare in
      oligodendrogliomas. These observations suggest that molecular genetic parameters 
      could provide an objective, reproducible framework for classifying
      oligodendroglial neoplasms.

TI  - Transcriptional response to hypoxia in human tumors.
PG  - 1337-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of hypoxic regions within solid tumors is associated
      with a more malignant tumor phenotype and worse prognosis. To obtain a blood
      supply and protect against cellular damage and death, oxygen-deprived cells in
      tumors alter gene expression, resulting in resistance to therapy. To investigate 
      the mechanisms by which cancer cells adapt to hypoxia, we looked for novel
      hypoxia-induced genes. METHODS: The transcriptional response to hypoxia in human 
      glioblastoma cells was quantified with the use of serial analysis of gene
      expression. The time course of gene expression in response to hypoxia in a panel 
      of various human tumor cell lines was measured by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction. Hypoxic regions of human carcinomas were chemically marked with
      pimonidazole. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to examine
      gene expression in the tumor's hypoxic regions. RESULTS: From the 24 504 unique
      transcripts expressed, 10 new hypoxia-regulated genes were detected-all induced, 
      to a greater extent than vascular endothelial growth factor, a hypoxia-induced
      mitogen that promotes blood vessel growth. These genes also responded to hypoxia 
      in breast and colon cancer cells and were activated by hypoxia-inducible factor
      1, a key regulator of hypoxic responses. In tumors, gene expression was limited
      to hypoxic regions. Induced genes included hexabrachion (an extracellular matrix 
      glycoprotein), stanniocalcin 1 (a calcium homeostasis protein), and an
      angiopoietin-related gene. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the genes that are
      transcriptionally activated within hypoxic malignant cells, a crucial first step 
      in understanding the complex interactions driving hypoxia response. Within our
      catalogue of hypoxia-responsive genes are novel candidates for hypoxia-driven
      angiogenesis.

TI  - Disposition of sperm donors with resultant abnormal pregnancies.
PG  - 1553-5
AB  - We wished to determine how clinicians manage sperm donors whose offspring have
      chromosomal or structural abnormalities. A directed, multiple-choice survey was
      given to reproductive endocrinologists and obstetrical geneticists to assess
      management of sperm donors whose offspring have chromosomal or structural
      abnormalities. The questionnaire was completed by 66 reproductive
      endocrinologists and obstetrical geneticists. Abnormalities and the most common
      inheritance modes included: Trisomy 21 (aneuploidy, maternal origin), Turner
      syndrome (aneuploidy, paternal origin), cleft lip/palate (multifactorial), VATER 
      sequence (vertebral defects, imperforate anus, tracheo-esophageal fistula, radial
      and renal dysplasia, sporadic inheritance), and Hurler syndrome (autosomal
      recessive). Response choices were: (i) remove donor from programme, (ii) inform
      potential recipients of prior pregnancy outcomes and continue to use donor, or
      (iii) further study donor to assess karyotype/mutations. Inheritance mode
      appeared to influence decisions to remove donors from sperm banks; however, no
      clear consensus was noted. Guidelines exist for screening potential gamete
      donors, but not for managing donors whose offspring has a chromosomal or
      structural abnormality. Guidelines must be developed to manage sperm donors with 
      untoward pregnancy outcomes.

      found to have papilledema and a pulsatile bruit. A dural arteriovenous
      malformation was not recognized on brain CT or MRI, but was well documented on
      magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography. Dural malformations
      draining into the superior sagittal sinus can cause increased intracranial venous

TI  - Type I diabetes mellitus in a patient with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
PG  - 17-9
AB  - We describe a patient with type I diabetes, clinical findings consistent with
      velocardiofacial syndrome, and a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. A nine-year-old boy
      presented with a history of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, hyperglycemia,
      ketosis, serum insulin antibodies, and a low C-peptide level. He had distinctive 
      facial features, learning disabilities, short stature, and a history of glottic
      web and clubfoot. Although a normal karyotype was obtained, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH) revealed a submicroscopic deletion in the
      DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome critical region at 22q11.2. His maternal
      half-brother also carried a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. His mother has similar
      facial features and hypoparathyroidism. Autoimmune problems associated with
      chromosome 22q11.2 deletions have been reported. We suggest that the defects in
      immune regulation due to T-cell deficiency in chromosome 22q11.2 deletion
      syndrome may predispose to autoimmune disorders, including type I diabetes
      mellitus.

PG  - 164-73
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/2.3.164 [doi]
AB  - Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have
      shown that the most frequent alterations are gains of chromosome 7, losses of 9p 
      loci and chromosome 10, and gene amplification, primarily of the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although this profile is potentially useful in
      distinguishing GBM from other tumor types, the techniques used tend to be labor
      intensive, and some can detect only gains or losses of genetic loci. Comparative 
      genomic hybridization (CGH) is a powerful technique capable of identifying both
      gains and losses of DNA sequences. The present study compares the CGH evaluation 
      of 22 GBM with classic cytogenetics, loss of heterozygosity by allelotyping, and 
      gene amplification by Southern blot analysis to determine the reliability of CGH 
      in the genetic characterization of GBM. The CGH and karyotypic data were
      consistent in showing gain of chromosome 7 accompanied by a loss of chromosome 10
      as the most frequent abnormality, followed by a loss of 9p in 17 of 22 GBM cases.
      Loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 10 (19/22) and 9p (9/22) loci confirmed the
      underrepresentation by CGH. Genomic amplifications were observed by CGH in 5 of
      the 10 cases where gene amplification was detected by Southern blot analysis. The
      data show that CGH is equally reliable, compared with the more established
      genetic methods, for recognizing the prominent genetic alterations associated
      with GBM and support its use as a plausible adjunct to glioma classification.

TI  - Ham56-immunoreactive macrophages in untreated infiltrating gliomas.
PG  - 637-41
AB  - CONTEXT: Classic diagnostic neuropathologic teachings have cautioned against
      making the diagnosis of neoplasia in the presence of a macrophage population. The
      knowledge of macrophage distribution should prove useful when confronted with an 
      infiltrating glioma containing macrophages. OBJECTIVE: To identify macrophages in
      untreated, infiltrating gliomas using the monoclonal antibody HAM56, and to
      confirm their presence in an untreated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with the
      serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method. METHODS: We evaluated the
      presence of macrophages in 16 cases of untreated, supratentorial infiltrating
      gliomas with the macrophage monoclonal antibody HAM56. We performed SAGE for one 
      case of GBM and for normal brain tissue. RESULTS: In World Health Organization
      (WHO) grade II well-differentiated astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, HAM56
      reactivity was noted only in endothelial cells, and unequivocal macrophages were 
      not identified. In WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma and anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma, rare HAM56-positive macrophages were noted in solid areas of
      tumor. In WHO grade IV GBM, HAM56-positive macrophages were identified in areas
      of solid tumor (mean labeling index, 8.6%). In all cases of GBM, nonquantitated
      HAM56-positive macrophages were identified in foci of pseudopalisading cells
      abutting necrosis and in foci of microvascular proliferations. In none of the
      cases were granulomas or microglial nodules found, and there was no prior history
      of surgical intervention, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or head trauma in
      these cases. By SAGE, the macrophage-related proteins osteopontin and
      macrophage-capping protein were overexpressed 12-fold and eightfold,
      respectively, in one untreated GBM compared with normal brain tissue. In this
      case, numerous HAM56-positive macrophages (labeling index, 24.5%) were present in
      the solid portion of tumor, and abundant nonquantified macrophages were
      identified in foci of pseudopalisading cells abutting necrosis and in foci of
      microvascular proliferations. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the utility of the
      monoclonal antibody HAM56 in identifying macrophages within untreated
      infiltrating gliomas. The overexpression of macrophage-related proteins in one
      case of GBM as detected by SAGE signifies that macrophages may be present in
      untreated GBMs.

TI  - Aberrant localization of the neuronal class III beta-tubulin in astrocytomas.
PG  - 613-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The class III beta-tubulin isotype (betaIII) is widely regarded as a 
      neuronal marker in development and neoplasia. In previous work, we have shown
      that the expression of betaIII in neuronal/neuroblastic tumors is differentiation
      dependent. In contrast, the aberrant localization of this isotype in certain
      nonneuronal neoplasms, such as epithelial neuroendocrine lung tumors, is
      associated with anaplastic potential. OBJECTIVE: To test the generality of this
      observation, we investigated the immunoreactivity profile of betaIII in
      astrocytomas. DESIGN: Sixty archival, surgically excised astrocytomas (8
      pilocytic astrocytomas, WHO grade 1; 18 diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas, WHO
      grade 2; 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, WHO grade 3; and 30 glioblastomas, WHO grade 
      4), were studied by immunohistochemistry using anti-betaIII monoclonal (TuJ1) and
      polyclonal antibodies. A monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 nuclear antigen (NC-MM1)
      was used as a marker for cell proliferation. Antibodies to glial fibrillary
      acidic protein (GFAP) and BM89 synaptic vesicle antigen/synaptophysin were used
      as glial and neuronal markers, respectively. RESULTS: The betaIII
      immunoreactivity was significantly greater in high-grade astrocytomas (anaplastic
      astrocytomas and glioblastomas; median labeling index [MLI], 35%; interquartile
      range [IQR], 20%-47%) as compared with diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (MLI, 4%; 
      IQR, 0.2%-21%) (P <.0001) and was rarely detectable in pilocytic astrocytomas
      (MLI, 0%; IQR, 0%-0.5%) (P <.0001 vs high-grade astrocytomas; P <.01 vs diffuse
      fibrillary astrocytomas). A highly significant, grade-dependent relationship was 
      observed between betaIII and Ki-67 labeling and malignancy, but this association 
      was stronger for Ki-67 than for betaIII (betaIII, P <.006; Ki-67, P <.0001).
      There was co-localization of betaIII and GFAP in neoplastic astrocytes, but no
      BM89 synaptic vesicle antigen/synaptophysin staining was detected. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the context of astrocytic gliomas, betaIII immunoreactivity is associated with
      an ascending gradient of malignancy and thus may be a useful ancillary diagnostic
      marker. However, the significance of betaIII-positive phenotypes in diffuse
      fibrillary astrocytomas with respect to prognostic and predictive value requires 
      further evaluation. Under certain neoplastic conditions, betaIII expression is
      not neuron specific, calling for a cautious interpretation of betaIII-positive
      phenotypes in brain tumors.

TI  - Chemotherapy of low-grade gliomas.
PG  - 138-44
AB  - Histologic subtypes of low-grade gliomas include pilocytic astrocytomas (World
      Health Organization [WHO] grade I), diffuse infiltrating astrocytomas,
      oligodendrogliomas, and mixed oligo-astrocytomas (WHO grade II). Although
      extended survival is typical with these tumors, most patients eventually succumb 
      to recurrent or progressive disease despite receiving either adjuvant radiation
      therapy or radiation at the time of recurrence. Not surprisingly, chemotherapy
      for low-grade gliomas has primarily been evaluated in the salvage setting of
      postradiotherapy progression in both adults and children. Unfortunately, the
      published body of literature describing chemotherapy for these tumors is small
      and subject to a number of confounding methodologic limitations. Nonetheless,
      some guidelines for the use of chemotherapy in these patients can be inferred
      from the published experience. The data reviewed clearly identifies a potential
      benefit for PCV chemotherapy (procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine) in at least a 
      subset of patients with low-grade oligodendroglial tumors. Nitrosoureas and
      platinum agents appear to have modest efficacy in recurrent oligodendroglial
      tumors and in some patients with newly diagnosed or progressive low-grade
      astrocytomas; however, surgery and radiation remain the primary treatment
      modalities for this group of malignancies. Until new data becomes available,
      chemotherapy still should be used only as a salvage option in previously
      irradiated patients with recurrent or progressive low-grade gliomas.

TI  - EGFRvIII as a promising target for antibody-based brain tumor therapy.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - Cell surface receptors are attractive candidates for targeted therapy of cancer. 
      Growth factors and their receptors play important roles in the regulation of cell
      division, development, and differentiation. Among those, the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) was the first identified to be amplified and/or rearranged
      in malignant gliomas. The most common rearranged form, EGFR type III variant
      (EGFRvIII), has a deletion in its extracellular domain that results in the
      formation of a new, tumor-specific target found in glioblastoma multiforme, as
      well as in breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung carcinomas. Monoclonal antibodies 
      have been developed with specific activity against this mutant receptor. These
      antibodies are internalized into the cell after receptor binding. Specific
      antibodies, either unarmed or armed with cytotoxic agents, including
      radioisotopes and toxins, have shown a promising role for EGFRvIII as a target
      for brain tumor therapy.

TI  - Enhanced S phase delay and inhibition of replication of an undamaged shuttle
      vector in UVC-irradiated xeroderma pigmentosum variant.
PG  - 233-41
AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) cells are defective in bypass replication of
      UVC-induced thymine dimers in DNA because they lack a novel DNA polymerase
      (polymerase eta). In this study the effects of UVC on S phase cells were compared
      in fibroblasts derived from normal donors (IDH4) and XP-V patients (CTag) and
      immortalized by expression of the SV40 large T antigen. These transformed
      fibroblasts did not activate the G(1) checkpoint or inhibit replicon initiation
      when damaged by UVC or gamma-rays. The transformed XP-V cells (CTag) retained the
      increased sensitivity to UVC-induced inhibition of DNA strand growth previously
      observed with their diploid counterpart. Cell cycle progression analyses showed
      that CTag cells displayed a stronger S phase delay than transformed fibroblasts
      from normal individuals (IDH4) after treatment with only 2 J/m(2) UVC. Low doses 
      of UVC also caused a lag in CTag cell proliferation. The extent of replication of
      an episomal DNA (pSV011), not previously exposed to radiation, was measured after
      the host cells were irradiated with 1-3 J/m(2) UVC. Replication of pSV011 was
      barely affected in irradiated IDH4 cells. Plasmid replication was inhibited by
      50% in irradiated CTag cells and this inhibition could not be accounted for by
      increased killing of host cells by UVC. These results suggest that even in
      transformed cells UVC induces DNA damage responses that are reflected in
      transient cell cycle arrest, delay in proliferation and inhibition of episomal
      DNA replication. These responses are enhanced in CTag cells, presumably because
      of their bypass replication defect. The accumulation of replication complexes
      blocked at thymine dimers and extended single-stranded regions in chromosomal DNA
      might sequester replication factors that are needed for plasmid and chromosomal
      replication. Alternatively, aberrant replication structures might activate a
      signal transduction pathway that down-regulates DNA synthesis.

TI  - Differential coupling of the human P2Y(11) receptor to phospholipase C and
      adenylyl cyclase.
PG  - 318-26
AB  - 1. The human P2Y(11) (hP2Y(11)) receptor was stably expressed in two cell lines, 
      1321N1 human astrocytoma cells (1321N1-hP2Y(11)) and Chinese hamster ovary cells 
      (CHO-hP2Y(11)), and its coupling to phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase was
      assessed. 2. In 1321N1-hP2Y(11) cells, ATP promoted inositol phosphate (IP)
      accumulation with low microM potency (EC(50)=8.5+/-0.1 microM), whereas it was 15
      fold less potent (130+/-10 microM) in evoking cyclic AMP production. 3. In
      CHO-hP2Y(11) cells, ATP promoted IP accumulation with slightly higher potency
      (EC(50)=3.6+/-1.3 microM) than in 1321N1-hP2Y(11) cells, but it was still 15 fold
      less potent in promoting cyclic AMP accumulation (EC(50)=62.4+/-15.6 microM) than
      for IP accumulation. Comparable differences in potencies for promoting the two
      second messenger responses were observed with other adenosine nucleotide
      analogues. 4. In 1321N1-hP2Y(11) and CHO-hP2Y(11) cells, down regulation of PKC
      by chronic treatment with phorbol ester decreased ATP-promoted cyclic AMP
      accumulation by 60--80% (P<0.001) with no change in its potency. Likewise,
      chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) decreased ATP-promoted cyclic AMP accumulation 
      by approximately 45% in 1321N1-hP2Y(11) cells, whereas chelation had no effect on
      either the efficacy or potency of ATP in CHO-hP2Y(11) cells. 5. We conclude that 
      coupling of hP2Y(11) receptors to adenylyl cyclase in these cell lines is much
      weaker than coupling to phospholipase C, and that activation of PKC and
      intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization as consequences of inositol lipid hydrolysis
      potentiates the capacity of ATP to increase cyclic AMP accumulation in both
      1321N1-hP2Y(11) and CHO-hP2Y(11) cells.

      analogue.
PG  - 1908-10
AB  - Patients with hypothalamic hamartomas and precocious puberty may develop gelastic
      seizures that are resistant to conventional antiepileptic drug therapies. While
      treating precocious puberty in two such patients with long-acting GnRH analogue, 
      the authors observed cessation of gelastic seizures. Although the mechanism is
      unclear, long-acting GnRH analogue should be considered as a possible therapy for
      gelastic seizures in patients with hypothalamic hamartomas.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided resection of glioblastoma multiforme by using
      5-aminolevulinic acid-induced porphyrins: a prospective study in 52 consecutive
      patients.
PG  - 1003-13
AB  - OBJECT: It has been established that 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induces the
      accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a
      phenomenon potentially exploitable to guide tumor resection. In this study the
      authors analyze the influence of fluorescence-guided resection on postoperative
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and survival in a series of patients who
      underwent surgery in the authors' department. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive
      patients with GBM received oral doses of 5-ALA (20 mg/kg body weight) 3 hours
      before induction of anesthesia. Intraoperatively, tumor fluorescence was
      visualized using a modified operating microscope. Fluorescing tissue was removed 
      whenever it was considered safely possible. Residual enhancement on early
      postoperative MR imaging was quantified and related to each patient's
      characteristics to determine which factors influenced resection. Survival was
      analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed in
      which the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, residual fluorescence, patient
      age, and residual enhancement on MR images were considered. Intraoperatively, two
      fluorescence qualities were perceived: solid fluorescence generally reflected
      coalescent tumor, whereas vague fluorescence mostly corresponded to infiltrative 
      tumor. Complete resection of contrast-enhancing tumor was accomplished in 33
      patients (63%). Residual intraoperative tissue fluorescence left unresected for
      safety reasons predicted residual enhancement on MR images in 18 of the 19
      remaining patients. Age, residual solid fluorescence, and absence of contrast
      enhancement in MR imaging were independent explanatory factors for survival,
      whereas the KPS score was significant only in univariate analysis. No
      perioperative deaths and one case of permanent morbidity were encountered.
      CONCLUSIONS: The observations in this study indicate the usefulness of
      5-ALA-induced tumor fluorescence for guiding tumor resection. The completeness of
      resection, as determined intraoperatively from residual tissue fluorescence, was 
      related to postoperative MR imaging findings and to survival in patients
      suffering from GBM.

TI  - Phase I trial of carmustine plus O6-benzylguanine for patients with recurrent or 
      progressive malignant glioma.
PG  - 3522-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The major mechanism of resistance to alkylnitrosourea therapy involves
      the DNA repair protein O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which
      removes chloroethylation or methylation damage from the O(6) position of guanine.
      O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)-BG) is an AGT substrate that inhibits AGT by suicide
      inactivation. We conducted a phase I trial of carmustine (BCNU) plus O(6)-BG to
      define the toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of BCNU in conjunction with 
      the preadministration of O(6)-BG with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with O(6)-BG at a dose of 100 mg/m(2)
      followed 1 hour later by BCNU. Cohorts of three to six patients were treated with
      escalating doses of BCNU, and patients were observed for at least 6 weeks before 
      being considered assessable for toxicity. Plasma samples were collected and
      analyzed for O(6)-BG, 8-oxo-O(6)-BG, and 8-oxoguanine concentration. RESULTS:
      Twenty-three patients were treated (22 with glioblastoma multiforme and one with 
      anaplastic astrocytoma). Four dose levels of BCNU (13.5, 27, 40, and 55 mg/m(2)) 
      were evaluated, with the highest dose level being complicated by grade 3 or 4
      thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. O(6)-BG rapidly disappeared from plasma
      (elimination half-life = 0. 54 +/- 0.14 hours) and was converted to a
      longer-lived metabolite, 8-oxo-O(6)-BG (elimination half-life = 5.6 +/- 2.7
      hours) and further to 8-oxoguanine. There was no detectable O(6)-BG 5 hours after
      the start of the O(6)-BG infusion; however, 8-oxo-O(6)-BG and 8-oxoguanine
      concentrations were detected 25 hours after O(6)-BG infusion. The mean area under
      the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 8-oxo-O(6)-BG was 17.5 times greater than
      the mean AUC for O(6)-BG. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the MTD of BCNU
      when given in combination with O(6)-BG at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) is 40 mg/m(2)
      administered at 6-week intervals. This study provides the foundation for a phase 
      II trial of O(6)-BG plus BCNU in nitrosourea-resistant malignant glioma.

TI  - Accelerated radiotherapy with concomitant ACNU/Ara-C for the treatment of
      malignant glioma.
PG  - 63-73
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate activity and toxicity of simultaneous ACNU and Ara-C with
      concurrent accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of
      high-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients aged 23-71 years (median
      47.5), 16 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 14 patients with
      grade-III glioma, received 93 courses of ACNU/Ara-C (median 4 courses) at
      following dose levels (ACNU/Ara-C in mg/m2/day): 70/90 (11 courses), 75/100 (36
      courses) and 90/120 (46 courses). ACNU was administered IV on day 1 of each
      cycle, Ara-C as a 2 h-intravenous infusion on days 1-3. Patients received
      concomitant radiation therapy with 2 daily fractions of 1.75 Gy up to 57 Gy
      (median). RESULTS: Median survival of all patients was 13 months, 11 months for
      GBM and > 28 months for grade-III glioma; 31% (9 patients) survived longer than
      24 months. The percentage of grade IV hematological toxicity was dose-dependent: 
      33% at the 70/90 dose level, 40% at 75/100 and 58% at 90/120. Six patients
      required platelet transfusion, 1 patient red blood cells; no febrile neutropenia 
      occurred. Among 18 patients evaluable for response, 3 (17%) showed PR, 8 (44%) NC
      and 7 (39%) PD at completion of chemoradiation. No acute or late neurological
      toxicity occurred in this study. Younger age (p = 0.0001) and grade-III histology
      (p = 0.0009) were important prognostic factors for prolonged survival.
      CONCLUSION: This chemoradiation regimen is active in malignant gliomas and can be
      safely recommended at a dose level using 70 mg/m2 ACNU together with 90 mg/m2
      Ara-C.

TI  - Mottled coloration in a rainbow trout is associated with mosaicism for albinism.
PG  - 405-7
AB  - Within a group of rainbow trout at a commercial farm, a single individual was
      noted for its mottled yellow and dark skin pigmentation. This female fish was
      reared to sexual maturity and sublots of its eggs were crossed to rainbow trout
      males from golden, albino, and wild-type (dark-pigmented) strains. Development in
      other eggs was activated to produce diploid gynogenetic offspring. Coloration
      within each progeny group was scored at 10 weeks following initiation of feeding.
      Mottled coloration was observed in none of the progeny at this time. The
      phenotypes observed (palomino, albino, and/or wild type) and their proportions
      within progeny groups indicated that the mottled female was originally
      heterozygous for albinism. The fish apparently became mosaic for this trait
      following mutation of the wild-type allele at the albinism locus within a cell(s)
      early in embryonic development. Curiously, at approximately 6 months after
      initiation of feeding, mottled coloration became apparent in 2 fish from among 25
      progeny of the cross to the golden male. No change in phenotype was noted at this
      time in 9 gynogenetic progeny nor in 68 progeny from the cross to the albino
      male. Apparently additional mutations and/or other genetic and regulatory
      processes affecting coloration came into play during juvenile development of
      these latter two fish.

TI  - Velocardiofacial syndrome: incidence of immune cytopenias.
PG  - 1141-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is associated with a broad clinical 
      spectrum that frequently overlaps the DiGeorge syndrome. Both have been linked to
      chromosomal microdeletions of chromosome 22 (22q11.2). DiGeorge syndrome is
      associated with T-cell dysfunction. What is the incidence of immune cytopenias in
      children with VCFS? OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify, (2) characterize, (3) quantify, 
      and (4) follow up the immunologic deficits in children initially seen in our
      institution with VCFS. DESIGN: Prospective clinical evaluation of patients with
      the features of VCFS. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive children with the clinical
      diagnoses of VCFS. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: All 20 children had genetics evaluation with chromosomal analysis.
      Immunologic evaluations included serum immunoglobulin concentrations, lymphocyte 
      studies, and mitogen and antigen stimulation studies. RESULTS: Five (25%) of 20
      children were noted to have T-cell dysfunction with a clinical presentation
      marked by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Three of these 5 children
      had resolution of the T-cell dysfunction over a 2-year period. The 2 children
      with persistent cytopenias combined with immunoglobulin dysfunction required
      intravenous IgG infusions to control their infections. CONCLUSIONS:
      Velocardiofacial syndrome is associated with an increased incidence of immune
      cytopenias and, thus, warrants evaluation in any child with the clinical
      diagnosis of VCFS. This immune deficit may be transient and depends on the age of
      the evaluation of the child.

TI  - Evaluation of pre-radiotherapy cyclophosphamide in patients with newly diagnosed 
      glioblastoma multiforme. Writing Committee for The Brain Tumor Center at Duke.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that has shown activity in the treatment 
      of pediatric brain tumors, including high-grade gliomas. This study was designed 
      to evaluate the response of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
      to pre-radiotherapy cyclophosphamide. Fourteen patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2/day for 2 doses
      every 28 days) followed by either sargramostim or filgrastin. Sargramostim was
      given 250 microg/m2 subcutaneously twice a day continuing through the leukocyte
      nadir until the absolute neutrophil count was more than 1000 cells/microl for 2
      consecutive days. The filgrastin dose was 10 microg/kg given subcutaneously once 
      daily until the post nadir absolute neutrophil count was > or = 10,000
      cells/microl. A total of 46 courses was given. Four patients received a total of 
      3 courses, 7 patients completed 4 courses and 3 patients received 2 courses.
      Three patients demonstrated complete response; 3 stable disease; and 8
      progressive disease. The most common toxicity was hematologic, requiring platelet
      and packed red blood cell transfusions, with 13 admissions for neutropenia with
      fever. There were no deaths related to infection or bleeding. These results
      suggest that high-dose cyclophosphamide has modest activity with acceptable
      toxicity against newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

TI  - Temozolomide in early stages of newly diagnosed malignant glioma and neoplastic
      meningitis.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - Temozolomide is a novel, oral, second-generation alkylating agent. Preclinical
      and phase I/II studies have demonstrated its efficacy against newly diagnosed
      high-grade glioma and anaplastic astrocytoma. Its antineoplastic effect is
      accompanied by quality of life benefits in patients with these debilitating
      tumors. Neoplastic meningitis, a refractory disorder, develops in approximately
      3% to 8% of patients with systemic cancers. Traditional approaches to
      leptomeningeal metastases, such as radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy, have
      limited success and a high degree of toxicity. Temozolomide offers a number of
      potential therapeutic advantages in this disorder, including activity against a
      wide spectrum of human cancers that produce neoplastic meningitis and penetration
      of the blood-brain barrier. Patients treated with temozolomide benefit from both 
      its systemic and intracranial activity. Recently, intrathecal temozolomide has
      been shown to increase median survival in athymic rats bearing subarachnoid human
      malignant glioma xenografts. Its efficacy, convenient dosing, and predictable
      safety profile make it an ideal agent for future study of these
      difficult-to-treat central nervous system malignancies.

TI  - Gliomas of the optic nerve: histological, immunohistochemical (MIB-1 and p53),
      and MRI analysis.
PG  - 563-70
AB  - Gliomas of the optic nerve, although typically of pilocytic (WHO grade I)
      histology, can present within the spectrum of astrocytic neoplasia including
      glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). In certain cases, histologic features alone make the
      distinction between pilocytic and diffuse astrocytomas difficult. We reviewed 22 
      cases of optic nerve gliomas, 19 of which were pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), and 3
      of which were diffuse, non-pilocytic astrocytomas. The cases were evaluated for
      their clinical course, radiographic appearance, histologic grade, and
      proliferation indices as detected by MIB-1 (Ki-67) and p53 antibodies. Of the 19 
      PA, 14 showed no tumor growth by magnetic resonance imaging, and had Ki-67 and
      p53 labeling indices (LI) of < 1%. The other 5 PA exhibited aggressive behavior
      manifest by marked diffuse infiltrative tumor growth causing death in 2 patients,
      1 of whom was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (immunoperoxidase and
      radiographs not available), and marked local growth with an average time to
      growth of 39.3 months, a Ki-67 LI of 2-3%, and a p53 LI of < 1% in three others. 
      Three of the five aggressive PA histologically demonstrated a finely reticulated 
      pattern, a pattern that appears as an exaggeration or expansion of the normal
      neuroglia of the optic nerve, and may simulate a diffuse low-grade astrocytoma.
      Two demonstrated the coarsely reticulated pattern, with the biphasic and
      microcystic pattern typical of PA. Three diffuse astrocytomas (2 anaplastic
      astrocytomas and 1 glioblastoma) originated clinically and radiographically from 
      the optic nerve, and revealed a Ki-67 LI of 2-12%, a p53 LI of 2-8%, and an
      average time to growth of 8 months. We conclude that the majority of PA of the
      optic nerve are non-aggressive, stabilize radiographically, and have Ki-67 and
      p53 LI < 1%. However, a subpopulation of PA has a propensity for aggressive
      behavior, and are identified by a Ki-67 LI of 2-3% and a p53 LI of < 1%. Diffuse 
      astrocytomas have both Ki-67 and p53 LI > 2%. Thus, in cases of aggressive optic 
      nerve tumors in which the histologic review of biopsy material cannot confidently
      confirm the diagnosis of pilocytic or diffuse fibrillary glioma, a p53 LI of > 1%
      appears to favor the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma.

TI  - Primary meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma in a child with hypomelanosis of Ito.
PG  - 762-5
AB  - Intracranial rhabdomyosarcomas are rare neoplasms, and those thought to be
      primary meningeal tumors are even more rare. Hypomelanosis of Ito is a
      neurocutaneous disorder believed to involve a defect in cells of neural crest
      origin. We report the case of a 15-month-old boy with hypomelanosis of Ito who
      developed a primary meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient initially presented
      with hydrocephalus and 2 months later developed neurologic signs localizing to
      the spinal cord. Radiologic studies revealed widespread leptomeningeal
      enhancement with compression of the spinal cord at C5-C7. A brain biopsy revealed
      a tumor diffusely involving the meninges. Microscopically, the tumor was composed
      of rhabdomyoblasts, many of which showed prominent cross-striations on routine
      hematoxylin-eosin staining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
      reported case of meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma in a patient with hypomelanosis of
      Ito and the fourth reported case of a primary meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma reported
      in the world literature.

TI  - Neonatal neoplasms.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe neoplasms diagnosed in children </= 28 days of age along
      with their treatment, associated congenital anomalies, and the long-term
      consequences of the diagnoses and treatments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Utilizing
      autopsy records, a computerized tumor registry, and medical records, we
      identified patients and stillborns at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC)
      diagnosed with neoplasms at </= 28 days of age between 1930 and 1998. RESULTS:
      Twenty-three neonates with neoplasms were identified. There were 7 males (30%)
      and 16 females (70%). Follow-up of survivors ranged from 4 months to 27 years
      (mean 9 years). The 20 patients identified via the computerized registry system
      for 1980-1998 constitute 2% (20/925) of all neoplasms seen in patients </= 16
      years of age over this same time period at DUMC. The histologic diagnoses were
      teratoma/germ cell tumor (n = 8, 35%), neuroblastoma (n = 5, 22%), retinoblastoma
      (n = 4, 17%), primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor (n = 3, 13%), and one
      case each of rhabdomyosarcoma, glossal glial choristoma, and hemangioma in the
      setting of Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome. Of the eight teratoma/germ cell tumor
      patients, 6 were female (75%) and 2 male (25%). There was one malignant germ cell
      tumor, 2 immature teratomas, and 5 teratomas. Two of the seven patients with
      immature teratomas or teratoma were long-term survivors following surgery. The
      one patient with malignant germ cell tumor, treated with surgery and
      chemotherapy, died. Associated anomalies were imperforate anus, congenital
      absence of a limb, left ventricular hypertrophy, fusion or absence of toes,
      coarctation of the aorta, and pulmonary valve dysplasia. Of the five children
      with neuroblastoma, 4 were female. INSS Stages were 1 (n = 1), 2A (n = 1), 3 (n =
      1), and 4S (n = 2). Two were treated with surgery + chemotherapy + radiotherapy; 
      two with surgery + chemotherapy; and one with surgery alone. Four children are
      long-term survivors. Associated congenital anomalies and medical problems were
      ventricular septal defect, seizure disorder, and Fanconi's anemia. A child with a
      dumbbell neuroblastoma, treated with surgery and chemotherapy, is paraplegic. Of 
      the four children with retinoblastoma, two were female. Two had trilateral
      disease and two bilateral. Three of the four had a family history of
      retinoblastoma. The two children with trilateral retinoblastoma died after
      therapy with surgery, craniospinal and orbital irradiation, and chemotherapy. Two
      children with bilateral disease are long-term survivors: one treated with
      radiotherapy + chemotherapy and one with radiotherapy alone. They have marked
      orbital bone growth abnormalities. The three patients with CNS tumors were
      female. The histologies were glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, and
      malignant mixed oligodendroglioma. Two of the patients are long-term survivors
      after surgery + chemotherapy. Six children received eight courses of radiation
      therapy: 2 for Stage 4S neuroblastoma with respiratory compromise from an
      enlarging liver and 4 for retinoblastoma. The two infants with trilateral
      retinoblastoma received two courses of irradiation each: one of the treatment of 
      intraocular tumor and a second, at an older age, for the pineal tumor. The most
      serious complication of anesthesia was a case of enterobacter cloacae sepsis in
      the central venous access line used for repetitively administering the
      anesthetic. CONCLUSION: The most common neonatal neoplasm histologic diagnoses
      are teratoma/germ cell tumor, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma. Neonatal
      neoplasms may be associated with congenital anomalies. Radiation therapy is
      administered infrequently in a population highly susceptible to late ill effects.
      When radiotherapy is required, anesthesia may be repetitively administered to aid
      in reproducible treatment.

TI  - Intrathecal busulfan treatment of human neoplastic meningitis in athymic nude
      rats.
PG  - 233-41
AB  - The current study was designed to evaluate the toxicity and activity of
      Spartaject Busulfan, a microcrystalline preparation of busulfan, following its
      intrathecal administration into a nude rat model of human neoplastic meningitis. 
      Animals were treated through permanent indwelling subarachnoid catheters. Human
      glioma D-456 MG growing in the subarachnoid space was treated with 8.1 micromol
      of intrathecal Spartaject Busulfan. Single-dose therapy was also subsequently
      compared with 4 doses of 8.1 and 2.0 micromol busulfan, respectively, against
      D-456 MG neoplastic meningitis. Additional experiments evaluated a saline control
      versus 8.1 micromol x 1, 6.2 micromol x 4 and 4.1 micromol x 4, respectively,
      against D-456 MG. A single dose of 8.1 micromol of intrathecal Spartaject
      Busulfan resulted in an increase in median survival of 61.7% compared with the
      saline control. In experiment 2, all busulfan treatments showed increases in
      median survival of 142.8% (8.1 micromol x 1), 52.3% (2.0 micromol x 4), and 23%
      (8.1 micromol x 4) (p < 0.001 for all groups) compared with the saline control.
      These results suggest that a narrow therapeutic dose range for both toxicity and 
      activity has been defined for intrathecal busulfan in the treatment of human
      neoplastic meningitis in athymic nude rats. Although busulfan has only limited
      activity against solid tumors, the high doses achievable in the CSF following
      intrathecal administration coupled with the steep dose-response relationships of 
      alkylating agents, provide rationale for further evaluation of this agent.

TI  - Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor homogenate induce immunity 
      against syngeneic intracerebral glioma.
PG  - 16-25
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of dendritic cell (DC) based therapy for
      intracerebral gliomas, we utilized a cell line derived from an astrocytoma that
      arose spontaneously in a VM/Dk mouse. This astrocytoma mirrors human gliomas
      phenotypically, morphologically and secretes transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-betas, immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by human gliomas. Systemic
      vaccination of mice with DCs pulsed with tumor homogenate followed by
      intracranial tumor challenge produced a > 160% increase in median survival (p =
      0.016) compared with mice vaccinated with PBS or unpulsed DCs (p = 0.083). Fifty 
      percent of mice treated with pulsed DCs survived long-term. Immunologic memory
      was demonstrated by survival of mice rechallenged with tumor. Both cell-mediated 
      and humoral immunity was induced. On histological examination only focal areas of
      demyelination at the tumor implantation site were present. There was no evidence 
      that autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced by DC vaccination. Therefore, in a 
      murine model, vaccination with DCs pulsed with glioma tumor homogenate is a safe 
      and effective therapy against a syngeneic glioma located in the immunologically
      privileged central nervous system (CNS).

TI  - Frameless neuronavigation applied to endoscopic neurosurgery.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed the indications, surgical techniques, and 
      applicability of frameless neuronavigation to endoscopic procedures in a
      heterogeneous group of 15 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 8 patients
      indications for surgery were cystic lesions, in 3 patients intraventricular
      tumors, and in 4 patients occlusive hydrocephalus. The mean age was 39 years
      (range 9-76 years). The follow-up period ranged from 5-24 months (mean 10
      months). Frameless neuronavigation was accomplished with the "operating arm
      system" in 10 cases and with the "optical tracking system" in 5 cases (RADIONICS,
      Burlington, USA). RESULTS: In all 15 cases, neuronavigation sufficiently provided
      anatomical orientation, preoperative planning, and intraoperative realization of 
      the approach. The calculated mean calibration error was 2.1 mm. There have been
      no permanent morbidities and no mortalities related to the use of endoscopes and 
      neuronavigation. CONCLUSION: In endoscopic neurosurgery, frameless
      neuronavigation is a useful tool in planning and realizing the approach and
      improving intraoperative orientation in selected cases. Indications are small or 
      hidden lesions, impaired visual conditions, abnormal anatomy, and narrow
      ventricles. Endoscopic procedures include fenestration and resection of
      intraventricular or intraparenchymal cysts, biopsy of intraventricular tumors,
      and third ventriculostomy in selected cases.

TI  - IgA nephropathy and Reiter's syndrome. Report of two cases and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the commonest type of primary
      glomerulonephritis worldwide. It has previously been reported in association with
      the seronegative spondyloarthropathies (ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's
      syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome and the postenteritic
      arthritides). Since this condition was first described in 1968, 5 previous case
      reports of biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy associated with Reiter's syndrome have
      been published in the English-language literature. Here we report 2 more such
      cases, along with a review of the literature describing the association of IgA
      nephropathy and a number of other immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritides
      with the seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

TI  - Microcomputer-based technique for 3-D reconstruction and volume measurement of
      computed tomographic images. Comparison of geometric and planimetry
      post-operative tumor volume effects on patient survival.
PG  - 377-92
AB  - The relationship between brain tumor size and survival has been studied since the
      advent of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, all published studies
      are based on tumor sizes measured by the less accurate geometric method, with
      results that are inconsistent. For example, the influence of the extent of tumor 
      resection on patient survival has been debated. Jelsma and Bucy advocated
      extensive resection based on their analysis of patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme, however, Green et al. produced conflicting results, showing that the 
      extent of resection was not statistically significant when all variables were
      considered simultaneously. The present study investigates whether or not the
      study inconsistency is largely due to the use of the less accurate geometric
      tumor volume measurement. The study demonstrates that the geometric tumor volume 
      and the planimetry tumor volume have significantly different prognostic effects.

TI  - Transplantation of thymus tissue in complete DiGeorge syndrome.
PG  - 1180-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder that affects the
      heart, parathyroid glands, and thymus. In complete DiGeorge syndrome, patients
      have severely reduced T-cell function. METHODS: We treated five infants (age, one
      to four months) with complete DiGeorge syndrome by transplantation of cultured
      postnatal thymus tissue. Follow-up evaluations included immune phenotyping and
      proliferative studies of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells plus biopsy of the
      thymus allograft. Thymic production of new T cells was assessed in peripheral
      blood by tests for T-cell-receptor recombination excision circles, which are
      formed from excised DNA during the rearrangement of T-cell-receptor genes.
      RESULTS: After the transplantation of thymus tissue, T-cell proliferative
      responses to mitogens developed in four of the five patients. Two of the patients
      survived with restoration of immune function; three patients died from infection 
      or abnormalities unrelated to transplantation. Biopsies of grafted thymus in the 
      surviving patients showed normal morphologic features and active T-cell
      production. In three patients, donor T cells could be detected about four weeks
      after transplantation, although there was no evidence of graft-versus-host
      disease on biopsy or at autopsy. In one patient, the T-cell development within
      the graft was demonstrated to accompany the appearance of recently developed T
      cells in the periphery and coincided with the onset of normal T-cell function. In
      one patient, there was evidence of thymus function and CD45RA+CD62L+ T cells more
      than five years after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In some infants with profound
      immunodeficiency and complete DiGeorge syndrome, the transplantation of thymus
      tissue can restore normal immune function. Early thymus transplantation - before 
      the development of infectious complications - may promote successful immune
      reconstitution.

TI  - Clinical significance of MCP-1 levels in BALF and serum in patients with
      interstitial lung diseases.
PG  - 376-82
AB  - It has previously been reported that the expression of monocyte chemoattractant
      protein-1 (MCP-1) in the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF) was different from that in the tissues of patients with other
      interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). The aim of this study was to determine whether
      this difference reflects the amount of MCP-1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      (BALF) or serum of patients with ILD, and whether such a correlation, if it
      exists, is clinically useful. MCP-1 concentrations in the BALF and sera were
      evaluated in 86 patients with ILDs including IPF, acute interstitial pneumonia,
      interstitial pneumonia with collagen vascular disease (IP-CVD), chronic
      interstitial pneumonia (CIP), bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia,
      sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and in 10 normal healthy volunteers
      who were controls (NC). BALF MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in the IPF,
      IP-CVD, CIP and sarcoidosis groups compared with the NC group. The level in the
      IPF group was significantly higher than that in any other patient group. Serum
      MCP-1 levels in the IPF, IP-CVD, CIP and sarcoidosis groups were significantly
      higher than the NC group. No statistical difference was found in serum MCP-1
      levels between the IPF, IP-CVD and CIP groups. BALF MCP-1 levels were
      significantly higher than serum MCP-1 levels in the IPF group and lower than in
      the IP-CVD and CIP groups. Serum MCP-1 levels correlated with the clinical course
      of ILD treated with corticosteroid therapy. These results show that measurement
      of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      and serum may be helpful in discriminating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from
      other types of interstitial lung disease and that monitoring of serum monocyte
      chemoattractant protein-1 may be useful for predicting the clinical course of
      interstitial lung diseases.

TI  - Image-guided endoscopic ventriculostomy with a new frameless armless
      neuronavigation system.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Complications resulting from imprecise placement of the
      ventriculoscope and reduced visibility through the endoscopic lens under certain 
      conditions during third ventriculostomy have been reported in the literature. The
      following is a report of our first experience with image-guided endoscopic
      ventriculostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 1996 and October 1997, 
      11 patients diagnosed with aqueduct stenosis were found to be eligible for
      image-guided neuroendoscopy. The image-guided system (BrainLab, Heimstetten,
      Germany) links a freehand probe, tracked by a passive-marker sensor system, to a 
      virtual computer image space. A 4-mm rigid ventriculoscope (Storz Instruments
      GMBH, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used. RESULTS: Eight patients improved clinically 
      directly after surgery, two patients stabilized, and one patient improved only
      after insertion of an additional ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. The computer-
      calculated registration accuracy ranged from 1. 1 to 3.1 mm (median 1.4 mm) using
      3-mm computed tomographic slices. The accuracy of the tool tip calibration for
      the endoscope was in the range of 0.35-0.9 mm (mean = 0.47 +/- 0.21). The
      described technique provided maximal flexibility for the surgeon and helped in
      performing a safe and accurate endoscopical procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Although not 
      all cases of ventriculostomy require additional image guidance, we found the
      technique to be helpful in patients with atypical or large ventricles, in cases
      where orientation became difficult owing to bloody or blurry cerebrospinal fluid,
      and in patients with small foramina of Monroe, where the entrance angle of the
      endoscope needs precise definition for an atraumatic procedure to be performed.

PG  - 219-23
AB  - A simple and safe technique for performing an endoscopic third
      ventriculocisternostomy is described using a small-diameter semirigid
      neuroendoscope in conjunction with a perforated ventricular catheter to bluntly
      fenestrate the floor of the third ventricle. All previous descriptions involve
      the initial use of an introducer sheath that in our experience lends to loss of
      cerebrospinal fluid, consequently distorting the anatomic landmarks of the third 
      ventricle as well as compromising the crucial concave shape of its floor. Our
      technique limits the loss of cerebrospinal fluid volume, therefore, reducing the 
      chance of basilar artery complex perforation as a consequence of distortion of
      third ventricular landmarks and loss of third ventricular floor concavity.

TI  - Hydranencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia in two kittens attributed to
      intrauterine parvovirus infection.
PG  - 39-53
AB  - Six weeks after vaccination with modified live feline parvovirus vaccine, a cat
      gave birth to five kittens, three of which died soon afterwards. The remaining
      two kittens (A and B) survived, but at 8 weeks of age were unable to walk and
      showed abnormal behaviour, with lack of menace and oculovestibular responses, and
      severe dysmetria. These signs suggested multifocal disease associated with the
      cerebrum and cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe bilateral
      (kitten A) or unilateral (kitten B) hydrocephalus or hydranencephaly, combined
      with cerebellar agenesis (kitten A) or severe hypoplasia (kitten B).
      Hydranencephaly was confirmed histopathologically in both kittens. Parvovirus was
      isolated from the kidney of one kitten. Parvoviral DNA was amplified by the
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from paraffin wax-embedded brain of both kittens.
      The severe malformations observed in these kittens presumably resulted from an
      in-utero parvovirus infection, possibly due to vaccination, that occurred late in
      the first, or early in the second, trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - Tobacco smoking contributes little to facial wrinkling.
PG  - 133-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential detrimental effects of tobacco smoking have been widely
      cited. Tobacco smoking has been linked with facial wrinkling, but some previous
      studies have failed to take into account a number of potential confounders or
      were unblinded and thus subjective to bias. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to
      determine if there was increased facial wrinkling in smokers directly associated 
      with tobacco usage after controlling for solar risk behavior. SUBJECTS:
      Eighty-two smokers (> 10 cigarettes per day) and 118 non-smokers (< 100 lifetime 
      cigarettes) were recruited. Caucasian participants completed a questionnaire
      designed to assess demographic variables and other suspected factors related to
      wrinkling. METHODS: Three dermatologists, blinded to demographic information,
      reviewed three photographs of each subject and rated the wrinkling on a 100 mm
      visual analog scale. Stepwise linear regression was performed on all variables
      which attained a P < 0.1 level of independent significance. RESULTS: Overall the 
      model accounted for 75.4% (P = 0.0001) of the variance in wrinkling, and
      predictive variables (P < or = 0.02) included age (partial R2 = 0.69), smoking
      pack years (R2 = 0.04), hours of outdoor work (R2 = 0.008), freckling (R2 =
      0.007), and eye color (R2 = 0.004). A second model was created excluding age
      which accounted for 37.8% of the variance. The predictive variables in the second
      model (P < 0.08) included education (partial R2 = 0.08), smoking pack years (R2 =
      0.05), hours of outdoor work (R2 = 0.03), weight change (R2 = 0.02), female sex
      (R2 = 0.02), hours of lifetime sun (R2 = 0.03), tanning bed use (R2 = 0.01), and 
      sunscreen use (R2 = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking may significantly contribute to
      facial wrinkling, but accounts for only 6% of the explained variance. If there is
      a role for tobacco smoking in causing wrinkling, this role is a minor one.

TI  - Irinotecan therapy in adults with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.
PG  - 1516-25
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan 
      (CPT-11, Camptosar; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) in the treatment of adults
      with progressive, persistent, or recurrent malignant glioma. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients with progressive or recurrent malignant gliomas were enrolled
      onto this study between October 1996 and August 1997. CPT-11 was given as a
      90-minute intravenous (i.v.) infusion at a dose of 125 mg/m2 once weekly for 4
      weeks followed by a 2-week rest, which comprised one course. Plasma
      concentrations of CPT-11 and its metabolites, SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide
      (SN-38G), were determined in a subset of patients. RESULTS: All 60 patients who
      enrolled (36 males and 24 females) were treated with CPT-11 and all were
      assessable for toxicity, response, and survival. Pharmacokinetic data were
      available in 32 patients. Nine patients (15%; 95% confidence interval, 6% to 24%)
      had a confirmed partial response, and 33 patients (55%) achieved stable disease
      lasting more than two courses (12 weeks). Toxicity observed during the study was 
      limited to infrequent neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. CPT-11, SN-38,
      and SN-38G area under the plasma concentration-time curves through infinite time 
      values in these patients were approximately 40%, 25%, and 25%, respectively, of
      those determined previously in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer not
      receiving antiepileptics or chronic dexamethasone treatment. CONCLUSION: Response
      results document that CPT-11, given with a standard starting dose and treatment
      schedule, has activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. However, the 
      low incidence of severe toxicity and low plasma concentrations of CPT-11 and
      SN-38 achieved in this patient population suggest that concurrent treatment with 
      anticonvulsants and dexamethasone enhances drug clearance.

TI  - Malignant supratentorial ganglioglioma (ganglion cell-giant cell glioblastoma): a
      case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 342-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: From both epidemiologic and pathologic viewpoints, gangliogliomas
      exhibiting components of giant cell glioblastomas are extraordinary neoplasms. We
      report herein the case of a 6-year-old girl who presented initially with a World 
      Health Organization grade IV anaplastic ganglioglioma (a mixed ganglion cell
      tumor-giant cell glioblastoma). Despite aggressive management, the patient died
      of disease in a relatively short period. METHODS: Formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 microm for histochemical and 
      immunohistochemical analyses. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and
      immunohistochemically stained sections from the primary and secondary resections 
      were reviewed. Reactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament
      protein, synaptophysin, and Ki67 nuclear antigen was evaluated. RESULTS:
      Histologically, 2 distinct cell populations were noted on both the primary and
      secondary resections. The primary resection revealed a neoplasm having a
      predominant glial component consistent with a glioblastoma. Interspersed were
      dysmorphic ganglion cells supporting a diagnosis of ganglioglioma. The second
      resection (following therapy) demonstrated a much more prominent dysmorphic
      ganglion cell component and a subdued glial component. CONCLUSION: Although
      immunohistochemical analysis clearly distinguished the 2 tumor cell populations, 
      the identification of Nissl substance in neurons proved to be equally helpful.
      Although other cases of grade III gangliogliomas and rare cases of grade IV
      gangliogliomas have been reported, the present case is exceptional in that, to
      our knowledge, it is the only report of a patient who presented initially with a 
      composite grade IV ganglioglioma and who was clinically followed up to the time
      of death. This case allows direct comparison between the histologic findings in a

TI  - Endoscopic neurosurgery "around the corner" with a rigid endoscope. Technical
      note.
PG  - 27-31
AB  - Endoscopically "working around the corner" is presently restricted to the use of 
      flexible endoscopes or an endoscope-assisted microneurosurgical (EAM) technique. 
      In order to overcome the limitations of these solutions, endoscopic equipment and
      techniques were developed for "working around the corner" with rigid endoscopes. 
      A steering insert with a 5 French working channel is capable of steering
      instruments around the corner by actively bending the guiding track and
      consecutively the instrument. A special fixation device enables strict axial
      rotation of the endoscope in the operating field. Endoscopic procedures "around
      the corner", including aqueductal stenting, pellucidotomy, third ventriculostomy 
      and biopsy were performed in human cadavers. Special features of the used
      pediatric neuroendoscope system, i.e., reliable fixation, axial rotation, and
      controlled steering of instruments, increase the safety and reduce the surgical
      traumatization in selected cases, such as obstructive hydrocephalus due to a mass
      lesion in the posterior third ventricle, since endoscopic third ventriculostomy
      and biopsy can be performed through the same burr hole trephination. Limitations 
      of this technique are given by the size of the foramen of Monro and the height of
      the third ventricle as well as by the bending angle of the instruments (40-50
      degrees).

TI  - Post transplant CD8+ gammadelta T-cell lymphoma associated with human herpes
      virus-6 infection.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - Gammadelta T-cell lymphoma is a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that has
      been reported in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons. This report 
      describes a forty eight year old patient who developed gammadelta T-cell lymphoma
      four years after undergoing living-related kidney transplantation. The lymphoma
      expressed CD2, CD3, CD7, CD8 and CD56, and the gammadelta T-cell receptor and did
      not express CD5, CD4 and the alphabeta T-cell receptor. In addition, HHV-6 was
      cultured from the patient's bone marrow, marking the first time that this virus
      has been associated with gammadelta T-cell lymphoma. Since all patients with
      gammadelta T-cell lymphoma described to date have responded poorly to standard
      combination chemotherapies, the patient was treated with the purine analogue
      2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. While he responded transiently to treatment, long term
      remission was not achieved indicating that additional therapeutic approches still
      need to be developed, for the management of this disorder.

TI  - Photophysical studies on antimalarial drugs.
PG  - 282-7
AB  - Most drugs used in the treatment of malaria produce phototoxic side effects in
      both the skin and the eye. Cutaneous and ocular effects that may be caused by
      light include changes in skin pigmentation, corneal opacity, cataract formation
      and other visual disturbances including irreversible retinal damage (retinopathy)
      leading to blindness. The mechanism for these reactions in humans is unknown. We 
      irradiated a number of antimalarial drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine,
      hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, primaquine and quinacrine) with light (lambda >
      300 nm) and conducted electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and laser flash
      photolysis studies to determine the possible active intermediates produced. Each 
      antimalarial drug produced at least one EPR adduct with the spin-trap
      5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide in benzene: superoxide/hydroperoxyl adducts
      (chloroquine, mefloquine, quinacrine, amodiaquine and quinine), carbon-centered
      radical adducts (all but primaquine), or a nitrogen-centered radical adduct only 
      (primaquine). In ethanol all drugs except primaquine produced some
      superoxide/hydroperoxyl adduct, with quinine, quinacrine, and hydroxychloroquine 
      also producing the ethoxyl adduct. As detected with flash photolysis and
      steady-state techniques, mefloquine, quinine, amodiquine and a photoproduct of
      quinacrine produced singlet oxygen ([symbol: see text]delta = 0.38; [symbol: see 
      text]delta = 0.36; [symbol: see text]delta = 0.011; [symbol: see text]delta =
      0.013 in D2O, pD7), but only primaquine quenched singlet oxygen efficiently (2.6 
      x 10(8) M-1 s-1 in D2O, pD7). Because malaria is a disease most prevalent in
      regions of high light intensity, protective measures (clothing, sunblock,
      sunglasses or eye wraps) should be recommended when administering antimalarial
      drugs.

TI  - Transfection and overexpression of metallothionein-I in neonatal rat primary
      astrocyte cultures and in astrocytoma cells increases their resistance to
      methylmercury-induced cytotoxicity.
PG  - 414-20
AB  - Metallothionein-I (MT-I) was expressed in neonatal rat primary astrocyte cultures
      and an astrocytoma cell line by pGFAP-MT-I plasmid transfection under the control
      of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter.
      Following transient transfection of the pGFAP-MT-I plasmid, MT-I mRNA and MT-I
      protein levels were determined by northern blot and immunoprecipitation analyses,
      respectively. The ability of cells over-expressing MT-I to withstand acute
      methylmercury (MeHg) treatment was measured by the release of preloaded
      Na251CrO4, an indicator of membrane integrity. Transfection with the pGFAP-MT-I
      plasmid led to increased mRNA (2. 5-fold in astrocytes and 7.4-fold in
      astrocytomas) and MT-I protein (2.4-fold in astrocytes and 4.0-fold in
      astrocytomas) levels compared with their respective controls. Increased
      expression of MT-I was associated with attenuated release of Na251CrO4 upon MeHg 
      (5 microM) treatment. These results demonstrate that MT-I can be highly expressed
      both in primary astrocyte cultures and astrocytomas by pGFAP-MT-I plasmid
      transfection, and lend credence to the hypothesis that increased expression of
      MT-I affords protection against the cytotoxic effects of MeHg. Taken together,
      the data suggest that MT offer effective cellular adaptation to MeHg
      cytotoxicity.

TI  - Avoiding complicated shunt systems by open fenestration of symptomatic fourth
      ventricular cysts associated with hydrocephalus.
PG  - 314-9
AB  - Optimal treatment of the hydrocephalic patient with symptomatic Dandy-Walker
      malformation or trapped fourth ventricle remains controversial. We describe 6
      patients with symptomatic Dandy-Walker malformation or trapped fourth ventricle
      and hydrocephalus that were treated with an aggressive cyst fenestration. Four of
      the 6 patients had previously undergone five or more failed shunt procedures.
      There were no complications associated with surgery, and 5 of the 6 patients
      (83%) have remained asymptomatic with respect to their posterior fossa cysts. One
      patient has required subsequent fourth ventricular shunt placement. Median
      follow-up was 26 months (range 12-66 months). We suggest that suboccipital
      craniectomy and open fenestration is a valid treatment option in hydrocephalic
      patients with symptomatic Dandy-Walker malformation or trapped fourth ventricle. 
      Although the associated lateral ventriculomegaly will probably still require a
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the absence of a cystoperitoneal shunt system seems
      to minimize the incidence of complications and reoperation.

TI  - Appearance and rapid growth of retinal tumor (reactive astrocytic hyperplasia?).
PG  - 78-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumors of the retina are often seen in association with systemic
      syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and von Hippel-Lindau
      disease. These masses are either astrocytic hamartomas or capillary hemangiomas. 
      Retinal tumors unassociated with other systemic disease have also been reported. 
      METHODS: The ophthalmologic evaluation and clinical course of a 65-year-old woman
      who developed an epiretinal membrane followed by a vascularized retinal mass in
      the macular area are described. RESULTS: Appearance and rapid growth of the
      lesion were documented with fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. The
      lesion was treated with photocoagulation following growth that threatened the
      foveal region. Choroidal neovascularization subsequently developed toward the
      fovea, and visual acuity has remained poor. After 4 years of follow-up no local
      recurrence or systemic disease possibly related to the tumor has occurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of documented appearance and rapid growth
      of a retinal tumor that resembles a reactive astrocytic hyperplasia.

TI  - Acute leukemia following treatment of malignant glioma.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - We report two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following therapy for
      malignant glioma; one was a young women treated heavily with alkylating agents
      for glioblastoma and the other a young man treated with high doses of
      procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) for anaplastic astrocytoma. We
      found 26 other examples of therapy related leukemia in adult and pediatric brain 
      tumor patients. Including our two, there were 12 patients with malignant glioma; 
      median interval from treatment to diagnosis of AML was 31 months. Nine adult
      malignant glioma patients all received nitrosoureas, some as the sole form of
      chemotherapy. No definite cases occurred after radiotherapy alone. Based upon
      analogy with other cancers, the cumulative dose of chemotherapy, especially
      alkylating agents, is the major risk factor for development of secondary AML.
      Agents implicated include carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and procarbazine. 
      Conventional radiotherapy appears not to confer additional risk. Progressive
      macrocytosis, early dose reductions for thrombocytopenia, and refractory anemia
      may provide early diagnostic clues. Current glioma therapy is leukemogenic but
      the number of patients who survive the interval required to induce AML is small; 
      nevertheless, the identification of chemosensitive types of glioma, and subgroups
      of patients who derive the most benefit from chemotherapy, may result in
      increasing numbers of patients at risk of long term complications. If regimens
      such as PCV continue to prove valuable in neurooncology the risk of leukemia will
      require integration into the clinical decision process. A search for more
      effective therapy with minimal mutagenicity remains critical.

TI  - DNA mismatch repair and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase analysis and
      response to Temodal in newly diagnosed malignant glioma.
PG  - 3851-7
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the response to Temodal (Schering-Plough Research
      Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) of patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma, as 
      well as the predictive value of quantifying tumor DNA mismatch repair activity
      and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT). PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Thirty-three patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and five
      patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) were treated with
      Temodal at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days with repeat 
      dosing every 28 days after the first daily dose. Immunochemistry for the
      detection of the human DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2 and MLH1 and the DNA
      repair protein AGT was performed with monoclonal antibodies and characterized
      with respect to percent positive staining. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients with GBM, 
      complete responses (CRs) occurred in three patients, partial responses (PRs)
      occurred in 14 patients, stable disease (SD) was seen in four patients, and 12
      patients developed progressive disease (PD). Toxicity included infrequent grades 
      3 and 4 myelosuppression, constipation, nausea, and headache. Thirty tumors
      showed greater than 60% cells that stained for MSH2 and MLH1, with three CRs, 12 
      PRs, three SDs, and 12 PDs. Eight tumors showed 60% or less cells that stained
      with antibodies to MSH2 and/or MLH1, with 3 PRs, 3 SDs, and 2 PDs. Eleven tumors 
      showed 20% or greater cells that stained with an antibody to AGT, with 1 PR, 2
      SDs, and 8 PDs. Twenty-five tumors showed less than 20% cells that stained for
      AGT, with 3 CRs, 12 PRs, 4 SDs, and 6 PDs. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
      Temodal has activity against newly diagnosed GBM and AA and warrants continued
      evaluation of this agent. Furthermore, pretherapy analysis of tumor DNA mismatch 
      repair and, particularly, AGT protein expression may identify patients in whom
      tumors are resistant to Temodal.

TI  - Diphtheria toxin fused to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is
      toxic to blasts from patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia.
PG  - 4279-86
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that human granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin (DT388-GM-CSF) is
      toxic to patient acute myeloid leukemia progenitors bearing the GM-CSF receptor, 
      but not normal marrow progenitors. We now report that exposure of mononuclear
      cells from five of seven (71%) juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) patients
      and from 12 of 20 (60%) adult chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients to 
      10(-9) mol/L DT388-GM-CSF for 48 hours in culture reduces the number of cells
      capable of forming colonies in semisolid medium (colony-forming units-leukemia)
      10-fold to 300-fold (1 to 2.5 log decrease). In contrast, normal myeloid
      progenitors (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage) from six different
      donors treated and assayed under identical conditions were consistently
      insensitive to the same fusion toxin even when treated as highly purified CD34(+)
      cells. The leukemic progenitors from the two other JMML patients showed
      intermediate sensitivity to DT388-GM-CSF and the leukemic progenitors from eight 
      of the 20 (40%) CMML patients were not different from normal progenitors.
      Parallel measurements of the number and affinity of GM-CSF receptors on cells
      from the same samples showed no consistent differences between JMML, CMML, and
      normal light density or CD34(+) bone marrow cells. The increased sensitivity of
      leukemic progenitors from all JMML progenitors and some CMML patients to the
      fusion toxin is therefore not likely to be explained by an increased density of
      GM-CSF receptors on these cells. We also examined the DT388-GM-CSF sensitivity of
      two murine cell lines transfected with cDNAs encoding varying portions of the
      human GM-CSF receptor and/or beta chains. These studies showed that high-affinity
      ligand binding was sufficient for DT388-GM-CSF-induced toxicity, as this could
      occur even in the absence of functional signal transduction and that the
      background of the host cell had a major influence on the degree to which this
      decreased the toxicity of DT388-GM-CSF. The selective sensitivity to DT388-GM-CSF
      of leukemic progenitors from a majority of JMML and CMML patients suggests that
      this agent could have therapeutic potential for some patients with these
      diseases.

TI  - Phase I trial of O6-benzylguanine for patients undergoing surgery for malignant
      glioma.
PG  - 3570-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The major mechanism of resistance to alkylnitrosourea therapy is the DNA
      repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which removes
      chlorethylation or methylation damage from the O6-position of guanine.
      O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) is an AGT substrate that inhibits AGT by suicide
      inactivation. We conducted a phase I trial to define the presurgical dose
      required for depletion of tumor AGT activity in patients with malignant glioma.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were to be treated 18 hours before craniotomy
      with intravenous doses that ranged between 40 and 100 mg/m2 given over 1 hour.
      Resected tumor was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and AGT activity analyzed by
      high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Up to 13 patients were treated at a
      specific dose of O6-BG, with a target end point of > or = 11 of 13 patients with 
      undetectable tumor AGT levels (< 10 fmol/mg protein). RESULTS: Thirty patients
      with malignant gliomas were enrolled, with 11 of 11 patients treated at 100 mg/m2
      O6-BG demonstrating tumor AGT levels less than 10 fmol/mg protein. No toxicity
      was noted in any patient treated. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 100
      mg/m2 of O6-BG can maintain tumor AGT levels less than 10 fmol/mg protein for at 
      least 18 hours after treatment, a time interval in which
      bis(2-chloroethyl)nitrosourea (BCNU)-induced chloroethyl adducts are fully
      converted into interstrand cross-links. A 100-mg/m2 dose of O6-BG will be used in
      combination with BCNU in another phase I trial designed to determine the
      maximal-tolerated dose of BCNU.

TI  - Relation between mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene and idiopathic
      pancreatitis.
PG  - 653-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether genetic factors predispose patients to
      idiopathic pancreatitis. In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations of the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene typically cause
      pulmonary and pancreatic insufficiency while rarely causing pancreatitis. We
      examined whether idiopathic pancreatitis is associated with CFTR mutations in
      persons who do not have lung disease of cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We studied 27
      patients (mean age at diagnosis, 36 years), 22 of whom were female, who had been 
      referred for an evaluation of idiopathic pancreatitis. DNA was tested for 17 CFTR
      mutations and for the 5T allele in intron 8 of the CFTR gene. The 5T allele
      reduces the level of functional CFTR and is associated with an inherited form of 
      infertility in males. Patients with two abnormal CFTR alleles were further
      evaluated for unrecognized cystic fibrosis-related lung disease, and both
      base-line and CFTR-mediated ion transport were measured in the nasal mucosa.
      RESULTS: Ten patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (37 percent) had at
      least one abnormal CFTR allele. Eight CFTR mutations were detected (prevalence
      ratio, 11:1; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 23; P<0.001). In three patients
      both alleles were affected (prevalence ratio, 80:1; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 17 to 379; P<0.001). These three patients did not have lung disease
      typical of cystic fibrosis on the basis of sweat testing, spirometry, or
      base-line nasal potential-difference measurements. Nonetheless, each had abnormal
      nasal cyclic AMP-mediated chloride transport. CONCLUSION: In a group of patients 
      referred for evaluation of idiopathic pancreatitis, there was a strong
      association between mutations in the CFTR gene and pancreatitis. The abnormal
      CFTR genotypes in these patients with pancreatitis resemble those associated with
      male infertility.

      nervous system and accounts for a significant proportion of morbidity and
      mortality, in special epilepsy. The authors reviewed 3093 computed tomography
      scans out of 2554 randomized neurological patients evaluated during a one year
      period. Most patients (77.3%) were living in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. 1821
      (58.9%) CT scans were normal. NC was diagnosed in 236 patients based on
      tomographic criteria; the sex ratio was F:M 1.6:1. 219 (92.8%) patients had the
      inactive form of NC: 195 (89%) had only isolated intraparenchymal calcifications,
      and 24 calcifications plus hydrocephalus. Active forms were observed in 14
      patients: 8 with degenerating cysts, 4 with viable cysts, 1 with intraventricular
      cyst, and 1 with racemose form. Three patients had both forms, active (cysts) and
      inactive (calcifications). The most common clinical finding among patients with
      tomographic diagnosis of NC was headache alone (35.5%), followed by epilepsy
      (20.9%). There is a potential role of NC as a causal factor of epilepsy in most
      of our patients, but surely not in all of them. On the other hand, the finding of
      inactive NC (calcifications without hydrocephalus and/or meningitic reaction) in 
      patients with headache is probably fortuitous in most cases. In fact, the
      occasional finding of isolated calcifications in general population is not quite 
      rare, as it was observed in 3.3% of another series of 973 patients with head
      trauma submitted to CT scan and without epilepsy previous history. The presence
      of CT findings compatible with NC, especially calcifications, must be carefully
      correlated with the clinical context in each case. Only then, an unequivocal
      cause-effect with all its medical and epidemiological implications role can be
      established.

TI  - Absence of H(+)-ATPase in the intercalated cells of renal tissues in classic
      distal renal tubular acidosis.
PG  - 226-31
AB  - Proton-secretory defect is thought to be a major pathophysiologic mechanism
      leading to classic distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). However, there have been
      only two case reports demonstrating the absence of proton pump in renal tissues
      of the patients with Sjogren's syndrome. This study presents two cases of classic
      dRTA in which the absence of intact H(+)-ATPase was shown in their renal biopsy
      tissues by immunohistochemistry using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the 70
      kDa catalytic subunit of H(+)-ATPase from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles; 
      one of the cases is diagnosed as subclinical Sjogren's syndrome and the other is 
      idiopathic dRTA. A normal human kidney (NC) and the renal biopsy tissues from a
      patient with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritus whose proton secretory capacity
      was intact (DC) were compared as controls. The first patient, a 26-year-old
      woman, presented with quadriparesis. Her serologic tests revealed positive
      autoantibodies (ANA, SSA; SSB & RF), and a lower lip biopsy confirmed the
      diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. The second patient, a 43-year-old woman, who
      initially presented with a pathologic fracture of both femoral necks was referred
      for an evaluation for hypokalemia by the Department of Orthopedic Surgery. Her
      renal ultrasonography showed medullary calcification, and no autoantibodies were 
      positive. Serum electrolytes and blood gas analyses of the two patients indicated
      severe hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, and proton secretory defects were
      shown by a failure to lower the urine pH during marked acidemia induced by NH4Cl 
      loading and an abnormally low urine-blood pCO2 difference during bicarbonate
      administration. While stainings with the anti-H(+)-ATPase antibody in NC and DC
      were strongly positive in intercalated cells in the connecting tubules and
      collecting ducts, the tissues from both patients with dRTA were devoid of any
      anti-H(+)-ATPase staining in the intercalated cells. These results support that
      the pathophysiologic basis of impaired H+ secretion in idiopathic classic dRTA as
      well as Sjogren's syndrome is the absence of intact H(+)-ATPase pumps in the
      intercalated cells.

TI  - Anti-D: mechanisms of action.
PG  - 14-22
AB  - Immunoglobulin that recognizes and binds specifically to the erythrocyte D
      antigen (anti-D globulin, WinRho SDF; Nabi, Boca Raton, FL) has recently been
      shown to be an effective therapy for many patients with idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Its mechanisms of action are not completely
      understood. Intravenous (IV) infusion of anti-D into a D-positive recipient leads
      to antibody coating of circulating erythrocytes that are cleared primarily by the
      spleen. This immune-mediated clearance of sensitized erythrocytes occupies the
      reticuloendothelial system and allows survival of antibody-coated platelets.
      Based on clinical observations, experimental data, and theoretical calculations, 
      the efficacy of anti-D therapy in ITP depends on several factors that influence
      the amount of erythrocyte sensitization and the rate of immune-mediated
      erythrocyte clearance by the spleen. Antibody characteristics, including the
      antibody concentration, binding affinity, and dissociation constants, may be
      important, as well as the number of D-antigen binding sites on the erythrocytes. 
      Although the primary mechanism of action of anti-D is believed to be immunologic 
      blockade of Fc receptors (FcR) within the reticuloendothelial system (RES), other
      immunomodulatory effects are also possible.

TI  - [Niceritrol decreases serum phosphate levels in chronic hemodialysis patients].
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Since phosphorus retention in hemodialysis (HD) patients is known to be an
      important factor in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal
      osteodystrophy, phosphate binders have been needed for the control of serum
      phosphate levels (P). However, the calcium-containing phosphate binders that have
      been used widely can cause a rise in serum calcium levels and cause secondary
      hypoparathyroidism. We have recently experienced decreases in P after the
      administration of niceritrol (NT), a prodrug of nicotinic acid, for the treatment
      of low HDL-cholesteremia (HDL-C) in HD patients. The aim of the present study was
      to assess the mechanism of the P-lowering effect of NT in comparison with nicomol
      (NC), another prodrug of nicotinic acid. NT (750 mg/day) or NC (600 mg/day) was
      given orally to 10 or 14HD patients respectively. Blood samples were collected
      before the first dialysis of each week for the determination of serum urea
      nitrogen (UN), Cr, Ca, P, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-C.
      Serum nicotinic acid concentration (NAC) by gas chromatograph mass-spectrometry
      method was determined before, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the administration of
      these drugs. After NT administration, P was decreased from 6.2 +/- 0.4 mg/dl to
      5.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dl (1st week, p < 0.001, Mean +/- SE) and 4.5 +/- 0.3 mg/dl (2nd
      weeks, p < 0.001) with no change in UN, Cr or Ca levels; these significant
      decreases in P lasted for 8 weeks. NAC increased significantly after NT
      administration from 25.5 +/- 1.3 ng/ml to 549.8 +/- 102.2 ng/ml (4 weeks, p <
      0.01) and 431.7 +/- 51.4 ng/ml (8 weeks, p < 0.01). HDL-C also increased (33.6
      +/- 4.0 mg/dl vs 42.7 +/- 4.6 mg/dl, p < 0.05), but TC and TG did not change. In 
      contrast, no significant changes were observed in P, NAC and HDL-C after NC
      administration. These discrepancies could be ascribed to the differences in serum
      NAC levels. These data suggest that NT could be useful for the control of P in HD
      patients. However further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of the
      P-lowering effect of NT.

TI  - Painful generalised clonic and tonic-clonic seizures with retained consciousness.
PG  - 792-5
AB  - Two patients in whom consciousness and memory were retained during bilateral
      clonic or tonic-clonic seizures are reported on, and three patients reported on
      previously are reviewed. Ictal semiology differed from myoclonic and
      supplementary motor seizures, which are other seizure types characterised by
      bilateral motor movements and retained awareness. In the two new patients ictal
      pain was a prominent feature. It is proposed that propagation of seizure activity
      may be confined to the sensorimotor areas bilaterally while sparing the neural
      structures involved in maintaining consciousness and in processing language and
      memory. This unusual type of seizure may be misdiagnosed as a pseudoseizure.
      Detailed description of the ictal events and further laboratory evaluation
      including video-EEG monitoring may be necessary to make the distinction.

TI  - Proline-induced inhibition of glutamate release in hippocampal area CA1.
PG  - 333-9
AB  - Concentrations of proline typical of human CSF have been shown to potentiate
      transmission at Schaffer collateral-commissural synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells
      of the rat hippocampus. This study tested the hypothesis that proline enhances
      excitatory synaptic transmission by increasing glutamate release. Two
      concentrations of proline were used: a concentration typical of normal human CSF 
      (3 microM) and a concentration typical of CSF in persons with the genetic
      disorder hyperprolinemia type II (30 microM). Continuous exposure of hippocampal 
      slices to either concentration of proline potentiated Schaffer
      collateral-commissural synaptic transmission. Proline shifted the plot of field
      EPSP slope against fiber volley amplitude upward. Contrary to the original
      hypothesis, neither concentration of proline reduced paired-pulse facilitation;
      30 microM proline enhanced paired-pulse facilitation, whereas 3 microM proline
      had no effect. In line with its enhancement of paired-pulse facilitation, 30
      microM proline reduced both the K+-evoked release of glutamate and aspartate from
      CA1 slices and the release of glutamate and aspartate from CA1 synaptosomes
      evoked by 4-aminopyridine. These results suggest that the proline-induced
      potentiation of Schaffer collateral-commissural synaptic transmission probably
      involves a postsynaptic, rather than a presynaptic, mechanism. Concentrations of 
      proline normally found in human CSF little affect glutamate release. However,
      proline-induced inhibition of glutamate release may contribute to the
      neuropsychiatric disorders associated with hyperprolinemia type II.

AB  - An active immunotherapeutic strategy using transfected allogeneic cells for
      targeting the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) on intracranial 
      tumors was examined. Immunization with allogeneic 300.19/EGFRvIII cells induced
      CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes against EGFRvIII bearing syngeneic B16-F10 melanoma 
      or 560 astrocytoma cells (H-2b), but not against allogeneic NR6 cells (H-2q) also
      bearing EGFRvIII significant NK cell activity was also noted in vitro.
      Vaccination protected against intracranial challenge with EGFRvIII-positive
      tumor, with 50% long term survival. In vivo depletions of effector cell subsets
      demonstrated the requirements for both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells but not NK cells in 
      producing this protective effect. These data demonstrate the generation of
      significant, antigen-specific and MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic immune
      responses which are effective against tumors present in the CNS.

TI  - A sensitive and specific functional flow cytometric assay for the diagnosis of
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 648-56
AB  - A functional flow cytometric assay (FCA) for the immediate diagnosis of
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with simultaneous compatibility testing
      for alternative anticoagulant therapies, has been developed to provide rapid and 
      reliable results which effectively support patient management. The assay provides
      results within 1-2 h, uses readily available non-radioactive reagents, and
      employs standard equipment. Using the highly sensitive annexin V protein probe,
      the method detects activated platelets induced by heparin immune-complexes, with 
      300-fold increased binding to activated platelets. Twenty-five samples from
      patients clinically-suspected of having HIT (131 tests) and 10 normal control
      (NG) samples (36 tests) were simultaneously tested with unfractionated heparin
      (UH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and by the radioactive
      serotonin-release assay (SRA) (62 and 16 tests respectively). The FCA highly
      correlated with the SRA, showing 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity. Moreover, 
      the FCA exhibited higher resolution between positive and negative samples (an
      average value of 8.6-fold the NC versus 4.0-fold the NC by SRA). The LMWH showed 
      concordant results with UH (r = 0.95). We conclude that the functional FCA for
      HIT is practical, specific and sensitive, thereby permitting the rapid diagnosis 
      of HIT and the suitability of alternative therapies.

TI  - Chromosomal characteristics of childhood brain tumors.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - In the present cytogenetic analysis of 116 pediatric brain tumors, chromosomal
      abnormalities were demonstrated in 44 cases, 48 cases revealed only 46,XX or
      46,XY cells, and 24 cases were nonproductive. In contrast to studies of adult
      brain tumors in which isolated loss of one X or the Y chromosome is often
      encountered, 45,X,-X and 45,X-Y stemlines or sidelines were not observed in this 
      series of childhood tumors. Among the 17 medulloblastomas with cytogenetic
      abnormalities, chromosome 1 was most frequently affected by structural
      deviations; the most prevalent specific alteration (7 of 17 tumors) was loss of
      17p, through i(17)(q10) or unbalanced translocation. The majority of low grade
      astrocytomas had normal stemlines, although one pilocytic astrocytoma and one
      cerebellar astrocytoma had frequent telomeric associations and a second pilocytic
      astrocytoma had a clone with trisomy 11. Thirteen of 19 high-grade and recurrent 
      astrocytic tumors had abnormal stemlines that were approximately equally divided 
      among cases with chromosomal counts in the near-diploid, hyperdiploid, and
      near-triploid-tetraploid ranges. Although no consistent abnormalities were
      observed, subsets of cases had structural abnormalities of chromosome 3, 7q, 9q, 
      or 17p. The cases of childhood brain tumors described here demonstrate that
      45,X,-X, and 45,X,-Y stemlines or sidelines are rare in these tumors and confirm 
      frequent loss of 17p in medulloblastomas. High-grade astrocytic tumors in
      children frequently have abnormal stemlines, often in the hyperdiploid and
      polyploid ranges, and they differ from high-grade gliomas in the adult by lacking
      consistent numerical and structural deviations.

TI  - In vitro repair of oxidative DNA damage by human nucleotide excision repair
      system: possible explanation for neurodegeneration in xeroderma pigmentosum
      patients.
PG  - 9463-8
AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients fail to remove pyrimidine dimers caused by
      sunlight and, as a consequence, develop multiple cancers in areas exposed to
      light. The second most common sign, present in 20-30% of XP patients, is a set of
      neurological abnormalities caused by neuronal death in the central and peripheral
      nervous systems. Neural tissue is shielded from sunlight-induced DNA damage, so
      the cause of neurodegeneration in XP patients remains unexplained. In this study,
      we show that two major oxidative DNA lesions, 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol,
      are excised from DNA in vitro by the same enzyme system responsible for removing 
      pyrimidine dimers and other bulky DNA adducts. Our results suggest that XP
      neurological disease may be caused by defective repair of lesions that are
      produced in nerve cells by reactive oxygen species generated as by-products of an
      active oxidative metabolism.

TI  - Proliferative activity in human glioblastomas: evaluation of different Ki67
      equivalent antibodies.
PG  - 198-200
AB  - AIMS: Determination of proliferative activity in human gliomas may be of clinical
      importance. Immunohistochemical estimation of the proliferative index with the
      prototypic monoclonal antibody Ki67 is often used but has the disadvantage that
      it must be carried out on frozen material. However, novel Ki67 equivalent
      antibodies have been developed for use on formalin fixed and paraffin wax
      embedded tissue. In this study, the prototypic Ki67 antibody and several new Ki67
      equivalent antibodies were tested on human glioblastoma tissue. METHODS: Eleven
      glioblastomas were included in the study. The antibodies used were the prototypic
      monoclonal Ki67 and the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies MIB1 (monoclonal),
      NC-MM1 (monoclonal), NC-Ki67p (polyclonal), and rabbit antihuman Ki67 antigen
      (polyclonal). The prototypic Ki67 was used on frozen sections and the other Ki67 
      antibodies on microwave oven heated, formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded
      sections. RESULTS: All antibodies exhibited specific granular nuclear staining of
      weak to strong intensity. In some tumours the labelling indices were within the
      same range, whereas in others the antibodies elicited divergent values.
      CONCLUSIONS: All the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies provided satisfactory
      staining on paraffin sections. However, a significant spread of labelling indices
      was recorded in some cases. Therefore, Ki67 immunostaining is encumbered with
      some degree of uncertainty and requires further optimisation before it can be
      regarded as a reliable prognostic marker.

TI  - Proline-induced potentiation of glutamate transmission.
PG  - 271-82
AB  - The amino acid proline has long been suspected to serve as a modulator of
      synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain, but no such function has been
      identified. The selective expression of high affinity proline transport by a
      subset of glutamate pathways suggested that proline might play a role in synaptic
      transmission at these sites. This idea was tested with use of one such pathway,
      the Schaffer collateral-commissural projection to CA1 pyramidal cells of the rat 
      hippocampus. Proline enhanced the initial slope of the field EPSP without
      affecting axonal excitability or the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation.
      Proline-induced potentiation far outlasted the period of proline application and 
      required the activation of NMDA receptors. Proline enhanced Schaffer
      collateral-commissural synaptic transmission even when the connections between
      areas CA1 and CA3 had been interrupted. Potentiation was observed with a proline 
      concentration normally present in human CSF (3 microM). A concentration typical
      of CSF in persons with the genetic disorder hyperprolinemia type II (30 microM)
      produced a somewhat greater effect. Occlusion experiments suggested that
      proline-induced potentiation and tetanus-induced long-term potentiation utilize
      largely distinct transduction mechanisms. Proline-induced potentiation could be
      blocked by a prior high frequency stimulus, whether or not the stimulus evoked
      long-term potentiation. These results suggest that endogenous extracellular
      proline regulates the basal function of some glutamate synapses by maintaining
      them in a partially potentiated state. They may also facilitate understanding of 
      the seizures and/or mental retardation associated with genetic disorders of
      proline metabolism.

TI  - Surgical treatment of craniosynostosis: outcome analysis of 250 consecutive
      patients.
PG  - E2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgery for craniosynostosis has evolved rapidly over the past two
      decades, with increased emphasis on early, extensive operations. Older published 
      series may not accurately reflect more recent experience. Our study was designed 
      to analyze outcome in a large series of consecutive patients treated recently at 
      a single center. METHODS: We reviewed 250 consecutive patients who underwent
      surgical treatment of craniosynostosis between January 1, 1987 and December 31,
      1992. They were divided into nine groups by suture involvement: sagittal,
      unilateral coronal, bilateral coronal, unilateral lambdoid, bilateral lambdoid,
      metopic, multiple suture, the Klee-blattschadel deformity (cloverleaf skull), and
      acquired craniosynostosis. Outcome was analyzed in terms of residual deformities 
      and irregularities, complications, mortality, as well as the need for additional 
      surgery. RESULTS: There were 157 males (62. 8%) and 93 females (37.2%), with most
      of the male preponderance accounted for by the large sagittal synostosis group,
      which consisted of 82 males and 25 females. Median age at first operation was 147
      days. A named syndrome was present in 23 patients (9.2%) and was more common than
      expected with bilateral and unilateral coronal synostosis, the Kleeblattschadel
      deformity, and multiple suture synostosis. There were two deaths (0.8%), both
      with Klee-blattschadel patients, and 17 other complications (6.8%). Morbidity and
      mortality were significantly associated with secondary vs primary operations and 
      syndromic vs nonsyndromic patients. Outcome analysis revealed the best surgical
      results with metopic synostosis and significantly less good results with the
      Kleeblattschadel deformity, multiple suture synostosis, and bilateral coronal
      synostosis. CONCLUSIONS: Using modern surgical techniques, craniosynostosis can
      be corrected with good outcomes and relatively low morbidity and mortality,
      particularly for otherwise healthy, nonsyndromic infants.

TI  - Malignant supratentorial glial-neuronal neoplasms: report of two cases and review
      of the literature.
PG  - 485-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malignant neoplasms exhibiting mixed populations of neuronal and glial
      cells occurring in the cerebral hemispheres of young adults and children are well
      recognized, but rare. A confusing array of diagnostic terms has arisen. We
      describe two patients with such tumors and review the literature concerning these
      interesting cases. PATIENTS: A 21-year-old man and a 5-year-old girl presented
      with large, cystic, intracerebral lesions on magnetic resonance images, which
      proved to be composite neoplasms exhibiting malignant neurons and astrocytes.
      RESULTS: The 21-year-old man had a frontal lobe mass with enhancing and
      nonenhancing regions, which corresponded to cerebral neuroblastoma and anaplastic
      astrocytoma, respectively. The presence of occasional microtubules and rare
      primitive presynaptic processes, accompanied by antisynaptophysin
      immunoreactivity, established the neuronal nature of the cells in the enhancing
      region. The nonenhancing region was composed of a moderately cellular neoplasm of
      fibrillar astrocytes that were mitotically active. The 5-year-old girl presented 
      with a left parietal lobe neoplasm, which histologically was composed of lobular 
      proliferations of neuroblasts and glia. The neuroblastic populations exhibited
      evidence of maturation with small anaplastic cells, spindle-shaped cells, and
      large dysmorphic ganglion cells. The glial tumor showed both well-differentiated 
      fibrillary astrocytes with microcysts and anaplastic populations with central
      necrosis and pseudopalisading. CONCLUSIONS: Present classification systems
      devised to describe mixed neuronal and glial tumors do not adequately encompass
      the diversity of morphologies presented by these two cases. We conclude that the 
      terms cerebral neuroblastoma-anaplastic astrocytoma for case 1 and cerebral
      ganglioneuroblastoma-glioblastoma for case 2 are preferred because they convey
      useful clinical information by reflecting concepts already encompassed by the
      World Health Organization's classification system of tumors of the central
      nervous system.

TI  - High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue in patients with
      recurrent and high-risk pediatric brain tumors.
PG  - 1814-23
AB  - PURPOSE: We treated 49 patients with recurrent or poor-prognosis CNS malignancies
      with high-dose chemotherapy regimens followed by autologous marrow rescue with or
      without peripheral-blood stem-cell augmentation to determine the toxicity of and 
      event-free survival after these regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients
      had medulloblastomas, 12 had glial tumors, seven had pineoblastomas, five had
      ependymomas, three had primitive neuroectodermal tumors, two had germ cell
      tumors, and one had fibrosarcoma. Thirty-seven received chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 daily x 4 and melphalan 25 to 60 mg/m2 daily x 3. Nine 
      received busulfan 37.5 mg/m2 every 6 hours x 16 and melphalan 180 mg/m2 (n = 7)
      or 140 mg/m2 (n = 2). Three received carboplatin 700 mg/m2/d on days -7, -5, and 
      -3 and etoposide 500 mg/m2/d on days -6, -4, and -2. All patients received
      standard supportive care. RESULTS: Eighteen of 49 patients survive event-free 22+
      to 55+ months (median, 33+) after transplantation, including nine of 16 treated
      before recurrence and nine of 33 treated after recurrence. There was one
      transplant-related death from pulmonary aspergillosis. Of five patients
      assessable for disease response, one had a partial remission (2 months), one has 
      had stable disease (55+ months), and three showed progression 2, 5, and 8 months 
      after transplantation. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of these regimens was tolerable. 
      Certain patients with high-risk CNS malignancies may benefit from such a
      treatment approach. Subsequent trials should attempt to determine which patients 
      are most likely to benefit from high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell 
      rescue.

TI  - The hydromechanics of hydrocephalus: steady-state solutions for cylindrical
      geometry.
PG  - 295-323
AB  - Hydrocephalus is a state in which the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is
      disturbed. This fluid, produced within the brain at a constant rate, moves
      through internal cavities in it (ventricles), then exits through passages so that
      it may be absorbed by the surrounding membranes (meninges). Failure of fluid to
      move properly through these passages results in the distention of the passages
      and the ventricles. Ultimately, this distention causes large displacements and
      distortion of brain tissue as well as an increase of fluid in the extracellular
      space of the brain (edema). We use a two-phase model of fluid-saturated material 
      to simulate the steady state of the hydrocephalic brain. Analytic solutions for
      the displacement of brain tissue and the distribution of edema for the annular
      regions of an idealized cylindrical geometry and small-strain theory are found.
      The solutions are used for a large-deformation analysis by superposition of the
      responses obtained for incrementally increasing loading. The effects of
      structural and hydraulic differences of white and gray brain matter, and the
      ependymal lining surrounding the ventricles, are examined. The results reproduce 
      the characteristic steady-state distribution of edema seen in hydrocephalus, and 
      are compared with experiment.

TI  - Successful formation of a chimeric human thymus allograft following
      transplantation of cultured postnatal human thymus.
PG  - 998-1005
AB  - Transplantation of cultured postnatal human thymus was performed in a patient
      with complete DiGeorge syndrome. Biopsy of the graft 3 mo after implantation
      revealed normal CD1+ thymocytes in thymic cortical epithelial regions and CD1-
      thymocytes in thymic medullary epithelial regions, respectively. HLA analysis of 
      graft thymocyte and thymic microenvironment components demonstrated that
      developing thymocytes and thymic macrophages were recipient derived, while thymic
      epithelial components were of donor origin. The patient, who initially had no T
      cells and had profoundly defective T cell function, developed normal T cell
      responses to mitogens and Ags, tolerance to donor in a mixed lymphocyte reaction,
      and normal Ab titers after tetanus toxoid and pneumovax immunization. Thus,
      transplantation of cultured postnatal human thymic tissue in humans can form
      functional chimeric thymic tissue, and may provide a strategy to reconstitute the
      peripheral T cell pool in select congenital and acquired immune deficiency
      syndromes.

TI  - Characterization of the mechanisms of busulfan resistance in a human glioblastoma
      multiforme xenograft.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - Busulfan is an alkylating agent commonly used in the treatment of chronic
      myelogenous leukemia and in combination with cyclophosphamide in preparation for 
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Serial treatment of a childhood
      high-grade glioma xenograft (D-456 MG) with busulfan resulted in a
      busulfan-resistant xenograft, D-456 MG(BR). Cross-resistance to
      1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea was seen but not resistance to
      cyclophosphamide or CPT-11. Cytoplasmic levels of glutathione in D-456 MG(BR)
      were approximately one-half those found in D-456 MG. This depletion could not be 
      explained by levels of glutathione-S-transferase, or by amplification,
      rearrangement, or increased levels of transcript of gamma-glutamylcysteine
      synthetase. Furthermore, depletion of glutathione in D-456 MG did not alter
      busulfan activity. Quantitation of busulfan levels in D-456 MG and D-456 MG(BR)
      xenografts following treatment of mice at the dose lethal to 10% of the animals
      demonstrated that significantly lower levels of drug were achieved in D-456
      MG(BR). These studies suggest that alterations in drug transport or metabolism of
      busulfan may play a role in the resistance of D-456 MG(BR) to this alkylator.

      disease. To emphasize the need for tissue diagnosis, we present five cases of
      pineal region tumors, including germinoma, pinealoblastoma, pinealoma,
      astrocytoma, and meningioma. In addition, we discuss the differential diagnosis
      of pineal region tumors, emphasizing the histologic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
      differences between various tumor types.

TI  - Single-voxel proton brain spectroscopy exam (PROBE/SV) in patients with primary
      brain tumors.
PG  - 201-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Single-Voxel Proton Brain Exam (PROBE/SV) is an automated MR
      spectroscopic technique. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of 
      PROBE/SV as a diagnostic tool in patients with primary brain tumors and to
      compare our findings with the known information obtained from conventional
      nonautomated MR spectroscopic techniques. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We used PROBE/SV 
      to image 10 normal adults and 46 patients with primary brain tumors: 29
      glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), five anaplastic astrocytomas, and 12 low-grade
      astrocytomas. All studied were performed on a 1.5-T Signa unit. Average voxel
      sizes were 6-8 cm3. A corresponding point-resolved spectroscopy spectrum was
      obtained from normal-appearing brain parenchyma in each patient for comparison
      with the spectra from known areas of pathology. RESULTS: In patients with
      low-grade gliomas (grades 1 and 2), we observed decreased N-acetylaspartate (12
      of 12) and slightly increased choline (11 of 12) when we compared these
      metabolites with those in the spectra of patients' normal brains. This comparison
      in patients with GBM yielded markedly decreased N-acetylaspartate (29 of 29) and 
      prominently increased choline (27 of 29). In the short TE spectra, we frequently 
      saw lipid signal in high-grade tumors, especially in GBMs (12 of 20). We
      identified lactate peaks in high-grade tumors (anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM, 29
      of 34) and also in low-grade tumors (four of 12). The creatine signal in all
      gliomas was slightly less than that of healthy brain tissue. The lowest
      N-acetylaspartate, choline, and creatinine levels in conjunction with the highest
      lactate levels were usually found in necrotic portions of high-grade tumors.
      CONCLUSION: PROBE/SV is a simplified MR spectroscopy technique that reduces setup
      time and provides automatic on-line data processing and display. The voxel
      location can be selected to focus on the area of interest and to minimize voxel
      contamination from unwanted tissue. The results from our experimentation with
      PROBE/SV in patients with brain tumors generally concur with published reports of
      tumor spectra obtained by conventional MR spectroscopic techniques. The ease and 
      accuracy of this new technique make it a useful clinical tool in differentiating 
      human brain tumor grades.

TI  - Functional complementation of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E by
      replication protein A in an in vitro system.
PG  - 5014-8
AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is caused by a defect in nucleotide excision repair.
      Patients in the complementation group E (XP-E) have the mildest form of the
      disease and the highest level of residual repair activity. About 20% of the cell 
      strains derived from XP-E patients lack a damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB)
      activity that binds to ultraviolet-induced (6-4) photoproducts with high
      affinity. We report here that cell-free extracts prepared from XP-E cell strains 
      that either lacked or contained DDB activity were severely defective in excising 
      DNA damage including (6-4) photoproducts. However, this excision activity defect 
      was not restored by addition of purified DDB that, in fact, inhibited removal of 
      (6-4) photoproducts by the human excision nuclease reconstituted from purified
      proteins. Extensive purification of correcting activity from HeLa cells revealed 
      that the correcting activity is inseparable from the human replication/repair
      protein A [RPA (also known as human single stranded DNA binding protein, HSSB)]. 
      Indeed, supplementing XP-E extracts with recombinant human RPA purified from
      Escherichia coli restored excision activity. However, no mutation was found in
      the genes encoding the three subunits of RPA in an XP-E (DDB-) cell line. It is
      concluded that RPA functionally complements XP-E extracts in vitro, but it is not
      genetically altered in XP-E patients.

TI  - Uremic leontiasis ossea: "bighead" disease in humans? Radiologic, clinical, and
      pathologic features.
PG  - 233-40
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in
      patients with uremic leontiasis ossea (ULO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients
      with renal osteodystrophy developed marked hyperostosis of the facial and cranial
      bones. Radiologic studies included plain radiography of the skull (n = 5),
      computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction (n = 4), magnetic
      resonance imaging (n = 3), and fluorine-18 sodium fluoride positron emission
      tomography (PET) (n = 1). Specimens from bone biopsies (three patients) were
      examined. RESULTS: Skull and facial alterations were remarkably similar. Numerous
      nodules of varying attenuation and signal intensity in the widened diploic space 
      suggested brown tumors in different stages of evolution. Biochemical data and PET
      findings enabled confirmation of markedly increased bone turnover. Bone specimens
      demonstrated severe osteitis fibrosa. After parathyroidectomy, facial changes in 
      all patients stabilized or improved mildly. CONCLUSION: A similar entity in
      animals, "bighead" disease, which results from nutritional and uremic secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, may provide a useful animal model for ULO in humans. Mild
      forms of this entity may be more common than the scarcity of previous reports
      suggests.

TI  - A phase III randomized prospective trial of external beam radiotherapy, mitomycin
      C, carmustine, and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of adults with anaplastic
      glioma of the brain. CNS Cancer Consortium.
PG  - 793-802
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate strategies to overcome the
      resistance of anaplastic gliomas of the brain to external beam radiotherapy (ERT)
      plus carmustine (BCNU). Patients were > or = 15 years of age, had a histologic
      diagnosis of malignant glioma, and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or =
      60%. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In Randomization 1, patients were assigned to receive
      either ERT alone (61.2 Gy) or ERT plus mitomycin C (Mito, IV 12.5 mg/m(2)) during
      the first and fourth week of ERT. After this treatment, patients went on to
      Randomization 2, where they were assigned to receive either BCNU (i.v. 200
      mg/m(2)) given at 6-week intervals or 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP, 750 mg/m(2) IV
      daily for 3 days every six weeks), with BCNU given on the third day of the 6-MP
      treatment. Three hundred twenty-seven patients underwent Randomization 1. One
      hundred sixty-four received ERT alone, and 163 received ERT + Mito [average 52.7 
      years; 63% male; 69% glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); 66% had a resection; 56% KPS 
      > or = 90%]. Step-wise analysis of survival from Randomization 1 or 2 indicates
      that survival was significantly diminished by: (a) age > or = 45 years (b) KPS < 
      90%; (c) GBM/gliosarcoma histology; (d) stereotactic biopsy as opposed to open
      biopsy or resection. Median survival from Randomization 1 in both arms (ERT +
      Mito) was 10.8 months. Median survival from Randomization 2 was 9.3 months for
      BCNU/6MP vs. 11.4 months for the BCNU group (p = 0.35). Carmustine/6-MP showed a 
      possible survival benefit for histologies other than GBM/GS. Two hundred and
      thirty-three patients underwent Randomization 2. The proportion of patients in
      the ERT group who terminated study prior to Randomization 2 was significantly
      less in the ERT group than in the ERT + Mito group (20 vs. 37%, p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: (a) The addition of Mito to ERT had no impact on survival; (b)
      patients treated with ERT + Mito were at greater risk of terminating therapy
      prior to Randomization 2; (c) there was not a significant survival benefit to the
      addition of 6-MP to BCNU.

TI  - The importance of monitoring dialysis adequacy in chronic peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 349-61
AB  - The case of a patient who was noted to be malnourished but improved after his
      dialysis dose was increased is presented. This case and the discussion that
      follows emphasize the importance of proactively monitoring peritoneal dialysis
      adequacy and nutritional intake, supporting the notion that the dose of
      peritoneal dialysis is a major determinant of appetite and, consequently, of
      nutritional status. In the clinical setting, this influence is best indicated by 
      changes in the serum albumin level and ultimately in long-term patient survival. 
      The case discussion reviews the major principles and supporting literature,
      describing how we target peritoneal dialysis delivery and optimize nutritional
      status in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Human recombinant stem-cell factor induces melanocytic hyperplasia in susceptible
      patients.
PG  - 577-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant human stem-cell factor (SCF), a cytokine acting on
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, has potential for the treatment of several
      hematologic and oncologic disorders. In a hematology-oncology phase I trial of
      SCF, several patients had cutaneous hyperpigmentation at the SCF subcutaneous
      injection sites. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the pathogenesis of
      this hyperpigmentation phenomenon. METHODS: Skin biopsy specimens were obtained
      before, at the completion of, and after SCF therapy and were processed for
      histology, immunohistology, and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Skin at the site of
      SCF injection had an increased number of melanocytes, increased melanocytic
      dendrite extension, and melanin as compared with noninjected tissue.
      Immunohistochemical stains revealed an increase in staining with
      melanocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies HMB-45 and NKI/beteb, and a monoclonal 
      antibody to the receptor for SCF, c-kit. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous injection of
      SCF results in hyperplasia of melanocytes. SCF may be useful in the treatment of 
      melanocytopenic disorders, but caution may be necessary in patients with
      disorders of melanocyte proliferation.

TI  - Hydrocephalus and shunts in children with brain tumors.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - Children with brain tumors are at risk for developing hydrocephalus necessitating
      placement of a permanent shunt catheter. As comprehensive, interdisciplinary,
      multispecialty care is required for these patients, the pediatric oncology nurse 
      must become knowledgeable about caring for children with a shunt. This article
      focuses on the care of the pediatric neuro-oncology patient requiring shunting
      for hydrocephalus, including a review of cerebrospinal fluid flow and
      hydrocephalus, determinants of shunt placement, complications of
      ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and nursing considerations.

TI  - Identification of high versus lower risk clinical subgroups in a group of adult
      patients with supratentorial anaplastic astrocytomas.
PG  - 371-84
AB  - The present work investigates whether computer-assisted techniques can contribute
      any significant information to the characterization of astrocytic tumor
      aggressiveness. Two complementary computer-assisted methods were used. The first 
      method made use of the digital image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei, making
      it possible to compute 15 morphonuclear and 8 nuclear DNA content-related (ploidy
      level) parameters. The second method enabled the most discriminatory parameters
      to be determined. This second method is the Decision Tree technique, which forms 
      part of the Supervised Learning Algorithms. These two techniques were applied to 
      a series of 250 supratentorial astrocytic tumors of the adult. This series
      included 39 low-grade (astrocytomas, AST) and 211 high-grade (47 anaplastic
      astrocytomas, ANA, and 164 glioblastomas, GBM) astrocytic tumors. The results
      show that some AST, ANA and GBM did not fit within simple logical rules. These
      "complex" cases were labeled NC-AST, NC-ANA and NC-GBM because they were
      "non-classical" (NC) with respect to their cytological features. An analysis of
      survival data revealed that the patients with NC-GBM had the same survival period
      as patients with GBM. In sharp contrast, patients with ANA survived significantly
      longer than patients with NC-ANA. In fact, the patients with ANA had the same
      survival period as patients who died from AST, while the patients with NC-ANA had
      a survival period similar to those with GBM. All these data show that the
      computer-assisted techniques used in this study can actually provide the
      pathologist with significant information on the characterization of astrocytic
      tumor aggressiveness.

TI  - Sodium-lithium countertransport kinetics in IgA nephropathy: relation to plasma
      lipids and renal impairment.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - We have investigated the activity and kinetics of sodium-lithium countertransport
      (SLC) in patients with IgA nephropathy and their relationship to plasma lipids.
      Standard SLC activity, the Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax)
      were measured in patients who had IgA nephropathy with either normal serum
      creatinine (IgA-NRF), or raised serum creatinine (IgA-IRF), and normal subjects
      (NC). The standard SLC activity was raised in hypertensive patients with IgA-NRF 
      due to a raised Vmax in association with hyperlipidaemia. The Km was
      significantly lower and Vmax also tended to be lower in IgA-IRF. Km and Vmax were
      not different in IgA-NRF compared with the NC. There was no difference in the
      mean standard SLC activity between all three groups. The low Km and low Vmax
      resulted in a normal standard SLC activity being observed in IgA-IRF which is
      similar to the situation we have observed in a proportion of diabetic patients
      with nephropathy. The low Km in patients with IgA nephropathy may be due to
      inheritance associated with familial essential hypertension or to an acquired
      change of the kinetics related to a change in the environment of the plasma
      membrane during the development of renal impairment.

PG  - 500-4
AB  - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is the most common lethal cardiac defect in
      neonates. Options for treatment include cardiac transplantation and surgical
      palliation. When cardiac transplantation is chosen as the preferred option, a
      considerable delay may occur until a suitable donor is available. During this
      time, anesthetic care may be required for various surgical procedures. Associated
      anomalies seen in these infants and the anesthetic implications imposed by the
      abnormal cardiac anatomy are discussed.

      receptor.
PG  - 1596-9
AB  - The role of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in signal
      transduction is undefined. Nerve growth factor can activate the sphingomyelin
      cycle, generating the putative-lipid second messenger ceramide. In T9 glioma
      cells, addition of a cell-permeable ceramide analog mimicked the effects of nerve
      growth factor on cell growth inhibition and process formation. This signaling
      pathway appears to be mediated by p75NTR in T9 cells and NIH 3T3 cells
      overexpressing p75NTR. Expression of an epidermal growth factor receptor-p75NTR
      chimera in T9 cells imparted to epidermal growth factor the ability to activate
      the sphingomyelin cycle. These data demonstrate that p75NTR is capable of
      signaling independently of the trk neurotrophin receptor (p140trk) and that
      ceramide may be a mediator in neurotrophin biology.

TI  - Pathology of the pancreas in severe combined immunodeficiency and DiGeorge
      syndrome: acute graft-versus-host disease and unusual viral infections.
PG  - 908-14
AB  - Review of autopsies of 28 children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
      or combined immunodeficiency (CID) and three with DiGeorge syndrome showed a high
      incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the pancreas. Acute GVHD
      (seven cases: four SCID, two CID, and one DiGeorge syndrome) was characterized by
      lymphocytes around large to medium ducts, damage to ductal epithelium (focal
      necrosis, reactive nuclear changes, inspissated secretions in duct lumens), and
      periductal edema. Changes were judged indeterminate but suspicious for GVHD when 
      ductal damage was slight (six cases: three SCID, two CID, and one DiGeorge
      syndrome). All patients with pancreatic GVHD had received allogeneic bone marrow,
      fetal liver or thymus transplant, or nonirradiated blood products and had
      evidence of GVHD in other organs. Immunoperoxidase stain for HLA-DR showed
      strong-to-moderate staining of duct epithelium in two of four GVHD cases for
      which blocks were available. This change was nonspecific; weaker staining for
      HLA-DR was seen in cases with nonspecific abnormalities and in viral
      pancreatitis. Four cases had histological evidence of viral infection: two had
      cytomegalovirus pancreatitis, one had patchy parenchymal necrosis caused by
      adenovirus, and one had giant cell pancreatitis caused by parainfluenza virus.
      Mild nonspecific changes, such as focal fat necrosis or acinar dilatation, were
      seen in seven cases. One case had unexplained marked pancreatic atrophy and
      fibrosis. Acute pancreatic GVHD is not uncommon in autopsies of children with
      congenital immune deficiencies with GVHD of other organs; however, this finding
      may not have strong clinical implications in this group of patients. Careful
      attention to pancreatic ducts is necessary for diagnosis. Unusual viral
      pancreatitis may also be seen in this group, as well as nonspecific
      abnormalities.

TI  - Reticulated platelet counts in patients undergoing autologous bone marrow
      transplantation: an aid in assessing marrow recovery.
PG  - 319-24
AB  - Thiazole orange (TO) is a fluorescent dye that is commonly used for flow
      cytometric measurement of erythrocytic reticulocytes. This technique has also
      been validated for counting "reticulated" platelets, as a measure of bone marrow 
      thrombopoietic activity. Patients with an established diagnosis of idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have been reported to have a three- to five-fold
      increase in the percent of circulating reticulated platelets. The current study
      was conducted to determine if platelet reticulocyte counts predicted recovery of 
      bone marrow thrombopoietic activity following autologous bone marrow
      transplantation. We found an increase in the percent of circulating reticulated
      platelets preceding recovery of the platelet count; then, as the patients'
      platelet counts rose, the percent reticulated platelets fell. In patients with
      prolonged thrombocytopenia, a persistent increase in the proportion of
      reticulated platelets suggested a consumptive process, as opposed to failure of
      engraftment. Moderate transfusion of platelet concentrates did not interfere with
      the ability of the platelet reticulocyte measurements to detect increased
      thrombopoietic activity. Platelet transfusions did obscure any decrease in the
      proportion of reticulated platelets. Our results show that platelet reticulocyte 
      counts could be useful in monitoring the recovery of marrow function following
      autologous bone marrow transplantation.

TI  - Immunohistochemistry of the glial fibrillary acidic protein: basic and applied
      considerations.
PG  - 221-8
AB  - The immunohistochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein has
      proven its utility in the histologic identification of benign astrocytes and
      neoplastic cells of glial lineage in the central nervous system. Its application 
      in the developing nervous system has contributed significantly to following the
      histogenesis of neural tissue. Its identification in various forms of injury and 
      neoplasia has helped in discovering the function of astrocytes in these
      processes. In diagnostic neuropathology, its greatest contribution has been in
      the elucidation of the cellular constituencies of neoplasms previously considered
      of enigmatic origin.

TI  - HLA associations in IgA nephropathy and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.
PG  - 352-7
AB  - Twenty percent of patients initiating Medicare-supported end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) therapy in the United States have chronic glomerulonephritis-induced ESRD.
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) likely
      account for many of these incident dialysis cases, although patients presenting
      with advanced renal insufficiency may not receive renal biopsies. To determine
      whether HLA phenotype associations existed in the subset of IgAN and FSGS
      patients who develop ESRD, we analyzed HLA frequencies by race in patients with
      these etiologies of ESRD entered in the South Eastern Organ Procurement
      Foundation (SEOPF) database. Serologically determined HLA frequencies from 605
      renal transplant recipients with ESRD due to FSGS and 196 renal transplant
      recipients with ESRD due to IgAN were compared with those of 4,506 race-matched
      cadaveric kidney-donor controls. Race-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated 
      and fitted into a log-linear model to determine associations between the HLA
      system and ESRD due to IgAN and FSGS. Values reported were considered significant
      (P < 0.05) after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. HLA-B27 and
      HLA-DR1 frequencies were increased and HLA-DR2 frequency was decreased in
      African-American and white IgAN-induced ESRD cases compared with race-matched
      controls (race-combined OR of 2.10, 1.89, and 0.57, respectively; all P < or =
      0.004). HLA frequency differences were not observed in FSGS-induced ESRD patients
      compared with controls. The results of this study indicate that HLA-B27 and
      HLA-DR1 are positively associated and HLA-DR2 is negatively associated with
      IgAN-induced ESRD in patients of both races.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - MR imaging of high-grade cerebral gliomas: value of diffusion-weighted echoplanar
      pulse sequences.
PG  - 671-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of
      diffusion-weighted echoplanar MR imaging in the examination of high-grade brain
      gliomas compared with that of conventional spin-echo (SE) or fast spin-echo (FSE)
      MR imaging. We hypothesize that diffusion-weighted MR imaging may enable us to
      differentiate various tumor components on the basis of differences in the
      diffusion of water. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Conventional SE and FSE MR images were 
      obtained in 10 patients with high-grade brain glioma. Diffusion-weighted
      echoplanar MR images were obtained with a head gradient coil capable of providing
      diffusion-weighted imaging along the cephalocaudal axis. Using SE and FSE MR
      images as a baseline, we evaluated the diffusion-weighted MR images for
      usefulness in distinguishing tumor components on the basis of differences in
      diffusion. RESULTS: Areas of tumor that showed significant enhancement on
      T1-weighted SE MR images obtained after injection of contrast material were
      markedly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and had a lower apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) than the ADCs for nonenhancing tumor and peritumoral 
      edema. Cystic or necrotic portions of tumor showed the most signal suppression on
      diffusion-weighted images and were associated with the highest ADCs. On
      T2-weighted FSE MR images, areas of hyperintensity observed in white matter
      oriented parallel to the direction of the diffusion gradient could be
      differentiated into two patterns on the basis of findings on diffusion-weighted
      images: areas that showed marked signal suppression with a higher ADC, most
      likely representing areas of predominantly peritumoral edema, and areas that
      showed a lesser degree of signal suppression with similar but slightly lower ADCs
      than those of edema, most likely representing areas of predominantly nonenhancing
      tumor. CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted echoplanar MR imaging is a useful technique
      for examining high-grade cerebral gliomas. It enabled us to differentiate various
      components of the tumor (e.g., enhancing, nonenhancing, cystic, or necrotic) and 
      to distinguish areas of predominantly nonenhancing tumor from areas of
      predominantly peritumoral edema when the abnormality was located in the white
      matter aligned in the direction of the diffusion-weighted gradient.
      Diffusion-weighted echoplanar MR imaging appears to be a powerful tool in the
      characterization of brain neoplasms.

TI  - Oligo-2',5'-adenylate synthetase in pulmonary sarcoidosis and idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 496-500
AB  - Oligo-2',5'-adenylate synthetase (2,5AS) is an enzyme induced by all types of
      interferon (IFN). We measured the levels of 2,5AS activity in peripheral blood
      mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of
      patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (SAR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
      and normal controls (NC). In NC, the levels of BALF cell 2,5AS activity were
      approximately seven times as high as the levels of PBML 2,5AS activity. The
      measurement 2,5AS activity from isolated cells showed that the levels of 2,5AS
      activity are independent of cell differential from PBML and BALF cells. The
      levels of PBML and BALF cell 2,5AS activity in SAR were both significantly high
      in comparison with those in NC. In patients with IPF, the levels of PBML 2,5AS
      activity were significantly increased as compared with those in NC, whereas there
      was no significant difference regarding the levels of BALF cell 2,5AS activity
      between patients with IPF and NC. These results suggest the following: (1) in
      patients with SAR, IFN production is enhanced both in the alveolar space and
      peripheral circulation; (2) in patients with IPF, IFN production is greatly
      enhanced in the circulation, whereas IFN production is not enhanced in the
      alveolar space; and (3) IFN may contribute to the pathogenesis of SAR and IPF.

TI  - Acute toxicity from baking soda ingestion.
PG  - 57-9
AB  - Sodium bicarbonate is an extremely well-known agent that historically has been
      used for a variety of medical conditions. Despite the widespread use of oral
      bicarbonate, little documented toxicity has occurred, and the emergency medicine 
      literature contains no reports of toxicity caused by the ingestion of baking
      soda. Risks of acute and chronic oral bicarbonate ingestion include metabolic
      alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypertension, gastric rupture, hyporeninemia,
      hypokalemia, hypochloremia, intravascular volume depletion, and urinary
      alkalinization. Abrupt cessation of chronic excessive bicarbonate ingestion may
      result in hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, volume contraction, and disruption of 
      calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The case of a patient with three hospital
      admissions in 4 months, all the result of excessive oral intake of bicarbonate
      for symptomatic relief of dyspepsia is reported. Evaluation and treatment of
      patients with acute bicarbonate ingestion is discussed.

TI  - Relative risks of ventriculostomy infection and morbidity.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - Ventricular catheter placement is a common procedure for the management of
      increased intracranial pressure. Hypotheses regarding the etiology of infection
      of catheters center on two alternative assumptions: 1) contamination leading to
      infection occurs at the time of catheter insertion, implying that catheter
      duration has minimal effect on infection risk; and 2) infection of catheters
      derives from catheter contamination after insertion, suggesting that duration of 
      catheter use may significantly affect infection risk. We have studied the
      relative complication rate of ventricular catheter insertions using a
      retrospective approach (n = 161 patients and 253 catheter insertion procedures). 
      The overall infection rate was 4.1%, but the daily infection hazard increased
      exponentially with time, to a maximum daily rate of 10.3% by day 6 of catheter
      insertion. This increasing risk appears most consistent with the second
      hypothesis. The risk of non-infectious complications was 5.6%, including
      hemorrhagic occurrences and misplacement severe enough to require a new catheter 
      insertion. The daily hazard of infection approximately equalled the
      non-infectious risk of routine catheter replacement by day 5. Additional
      prospective data on the daily risk of CSF infection and the appropriateness of
      antibiotic prophylaxis either at the time of ventricular catheter insertion or
      continued through the catheter's presence may be required to both definitively
      identify which hypothesis of infection risk is correct and whether antibiotics
      can significantly ameliorate this risk.

      defects.
PG  - 559-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the common cold with or without
      fever in the first 3 months of pregnancy and birth defects in offspring. DESIGN: 
      A case-control study. SETTING: Data are from the Shanghai Birth Defects
      Monitoring Program, conducted in 29 hospitals in Shanghai, China from October 1, 
      1986 to September 30, 1987. SUBJECTS: A total of 986 birth defects cases, 990
      frequency-matched live birth controls, and 159 stillbirth controls. RESULTS:
      Modestly elevated risk of birth defects was identified among women who reported
      having a cold with or without fever in the first trimester of pregnancy. Notably 
      increased relative risks were observed for anencephalus (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9,
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 7.7), spina bifida (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.7 
      to 9.7), hydrocephalus (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.1), cleft lip (OR = 2.2, 95% 
      CI = 1.4 to 3.4), and undescended testicle (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.0). Our
      study further found that the overall relative risks were consistent by using two 
      different control groups, suggesting that this association was unlikely to be due
      to recall or report bias. CONCLUSION: Common cold in the first trimester of
      pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of birth defects in offspring.
      However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.

TI  - Phenotypic and clonal analysis of T lymphocytes in childhood immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura.
PG  - 2137-42
AB  - In an attempt to identify and characterize T-lymphocyte immunoregulatory
      abnormalities in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), we have performed
      phenotypic and clonal analysis on peripheral T lymphocytes from 23 children with 
      ITP. Quantitation of lymphocyte subpopulations showed that children with acute
      ITP had higher numbers of CD45RA+ and lower numbers of CD45RO+ T cells than
      children with chronic ITP or controls, but these differences may be age related. 
      Analysis of T-cell receptor variable beta gene usage identified 2 boys with
      chronic ITP and elevated numbers of V beta 8+ T cells. Eight T-cell clones were
      established (6 CD4+, 4B4+ helper-inducer lines and 2 CD8+ lines) that showed in
      vitro proliferation against allogeneic platelets. The addition of autologous
      antigen-presenting cells enhanced the proliferation of six clones, but not for
      two clones that coexpressed natural killer (NK) markers. Four of seven positive
      clones also had measurable interleukin (IL)-2 secretion following platelet
      stimulation, providing further evidence for T-cell reactivity. Our results
      provide the first evidence that patients with ITP may have platelet-reactive T
      lymphocytes identifiable at the clonal level, supporting the hypothesis that
      autoreactive peripheral T lymphocytes may mediate or participate in the
      pathogenesis of this disorder.

TI  - An analysis of radiotherapy data from the CNS cancer consortium's randomized
      prospective trial comparing AZQ to BCNU in the treatment of patients with primary
      malignant brain tumors. The CNS cancer consortium.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - The CNS Cancer Consortium has conducted a phase III study comparing diaziquone
      (AZQ) with carmustine (BCNU) in the treatment of adults with primary anaplastic
      glial brain tumors. Patients eligible for this study were 18 years of age or
      older at the time of biopsy, subtotal resection, or gross total resection of an
      anaplastic glial brain tumor. Within 3 weeks of surgery, patients received whole 
      brain radiotherapy at 1.7 to 2 Gy per fraction to a total whole brain dose of
      42-48 Gy. This was followed by a boost to the tumor bed as ascertained by
      computed tomography (CT), angiography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
      1.7 to 2 Gy per fraction to a dose of 12-19 Gy. The recommended cumulative dose
      to the tumor bed was therefore 55-61 Gy. At 8 weeks following radiotherapy,
      patients were randomized to receive either AZQ at 15 mg/day for 3 days i.v. every
      4 weeks or BCNU at 200 mg i.v. every 8 weeks. Chemotherapy was continued for at
      least 1 year unless death occurred, treatment failure was declared, or toxicity
      necessitated alteration of therapy. In the 249 randomized patients, there was no 
      difference between the AZQ- and BCNU-treated patients in age, sex distribution,
      race, tumor histology, type of surgical resection, or Karnofsky performance
      status (KPS). Age and KPS at the initiation of therapy and tumor histology were
      the best overall predictors of survival. The type of chemotherapy (AZQ vs BCNU)
      was not predictive of survival. Two-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 22% in the
      AZQ-treated patients and 25% in BCNU-treated patients. In an analysis of
      radiotherapy administered we found that, within the range of doses required for
      this study, there was no influence of whole brain dose, boost dose, total dose,
      or size of the boost field on survival. The institution providing radiotherapy
      (teaching hospital vs nonteaching facility) did not influence survival.

TI  - Pilocytic astrocytoma: correlation between the initial imaging features and
      clinical aggressiveness.
PG  - 369-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Astrocytomas are classified as either fibrillary or pilocytic on the
      basis of their histologic appearance. The imaging features of the fibrillary
      astrocytoma correlate closely with the tumor's clinical aggressiveness and are,
      therefore, useful in predicting prognosis. Correlation between the imaging
      features and the clinical aggressiveness of the pilocytic astrocytoma, however,
      is not well established. Accordingly, we compared the initial MR and CT
      appearances of the lesion with tumor aggressiveness as seen clinically to
      determine if a correlation exists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively
      evaluated the initial MR images or CT scans of 32 consecutive patients who had a 
      histologic diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. The lesions were evaluated with
      regard to location, size, calcification, morphology, and degree of contrast
      enhancement. These initial imaging features were correlated with the
      aggressiveness of the tumor as seen clinically. Tumors were classified as
      aggressive or nonaggressive on the basis of their clinical manifestations.
      Patients with clinically aggressive lesions had progressive symptoms and
      radiologic evidence of tumor progression or recurrence within an unusually short 
      period. Patients with clinically nonaggressive lesions had a more indolent
      course, either improving or remaining stable, on both clinical and radiologic
      evaluations. In 12 patients, the tumor was classified as aggressive clinically,
      either progressing or recurring within a median time of 7.5 months (range,
      2.5-118 months) from the initial diagnosis. The remaining 20 patients had a
      clinically nonaggressive course. RESULTS: In our series of patients, lesion size 
      and location were not significantly different between the nonaggressive and
      aggressive tumors, as noted clinically. Furthermore, the aggressive and
      nonaggressive tumors were similar with regard to the presence or absence of
      calcium. Most tumors in both groups showed either moderate or marked enhancement 
      and were multilobular. CONCLUSION: The initial CT and MR features of pilocytic
      astrocytoma are unreliable for predicting which lesions will behave in a more
      aggressive manner clinically and have a poor prognosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the changes in tumor [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose
      (FDG) uptake on serial FDG-PET studies and the ability of serial FDG-PET studies 
      to predict survival in patients with treated and untreated primary brain tumors. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 20 patients with primary
      brain tumors. Changes in FDG uptake over time were visually assessed and
      correlated with clinical course and survival. RESULTS: Although little change in 
      FDG uptake was noted for individual patients, high average FDG uptake (greater
      than or equal to gray matter) on serial studies was associated with shorter
      survival. Patients with persistently low FDG uptake (less than gray matter)
      survived significantly longer than patients with persistently high FDG uptake (p 
      = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Serial evaluation of metabolic activity with PET may
      provide more accurate prognostic information than a single FDG uptake
      determination in patients with primary brain tumors.

TI  - Temporal lobe hypometabolism on PET: predictor of seizure control after temporal 
      lobectomy.
PG  - 1088-92
AB  - To investigate the relationship of temporal lobe hypometabolism demonstrated on
      PET to surgical outcome and underlying pathology, we reviewed 30 consecutive
      epilepsy patients who underwent interictal PET studies with 18F
      fluorodeoxyglucose before temporal lobectomy. Two interpreters blindly reviewed
      the PET studies and graded them for degree, extent, and location of temporal lobe
      hypometabolism. Pathologic analysis of en bloc resected tissue showed mesial
      temporal sclerosis (n = 22), astrocytoma (n = 2), and no pathologic diagnosis (n 
      = 6). Outcome (24 to 40 months' follow-up) was rated as seizure-free (21
      patients), significantly improved (five patients), and not significantly improved
      (four patients). Both the degree and extent of the temporal lobe hypometabolism
      demonstrated on PET were strongly associated with subsequent seizure control.
      Pathologic findings, however, did not correlate with degree of PET hypometabolism
      or subsequent outcome. These data demonstrate that in patients judged to have
      temporal lobe epilepsy, the presence of temporal lobe hypometabolism is
      associated with a positive outcome after ipsilateral temporal lobectomy.

TI  - Mesenrhombencephalitis: MR findings in nine patients.
PG  - 1089-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mesenrhombencephalitis is a serious form of brainstem inflammation
      predominantly involving the deep and vital portions of the brain, that is, the
      mesencephalon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (pons, medulla).
      Mesenrhombencephalitis is difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical and
      laboratory findings alone, and access to this portion of the brain for surgical
      biopsy carries high morbidity. We describe the MR appearance of
      mesenrhombencephalitis and correlate the imaging findings with clinical
      information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MR images of
      nine patients with mesenrhombencephalitis were reviewed retrospectively and
      correlated with clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data. The patients were
      categorized according to the cause of the disease: three had herpes simplex, one 
      had Listeria monocytogenes, and five had mesenrhombencephalitis of undetermined
      cause. The three patients with clinical and MR evidence of herpes simplex
      mesenrhombencephalitis (one confirmed by brain biopsy) were comatose at
      presentation, with cranial nerve abnormalities in two and seizures in one. One
      patient with L. monocytogenes (established by blood culture) had cranial nerve
      palsies, fever, and pain in the ear. Five additional patients had headache
      (three), fever (three), nausea and vomiting (four), cranial nerve palsies
      (three), coma (two), and hyporeflexia (one) or hyperreflexia (four). Brain biopsy
      performed in two patients revealed chronic inflammation of unspecified cause; in 
      one, it was compatible with viral encephalitis. RESULTS: MR images in three
      patients with herpes simplex mesenrhombencephalitis showed T2 signal
      hyperintensity in the midbrain (two), pons (one), medulla (one), and temporal
      lobes (three). Parenchymal foci of hemorrhage (methemoglobin, one patient) and
      leptomeningeal enhancement (one patient) were identified in the temporal lobes.
      T2-weighted MR images in one patient with L. monocytogenes showed signal
      hyperintensity in the brainstem, vermis, midbrain, and internal capsules. On
      T1-weighted images, low signal was present in these areas, which enhanced with
      paramagnetic contrast agents. In the remaining five patients, T2-weighted MR
      images showed patchy signal hyperintensity in the pons, medulla, and thalamus in 
      three each and in the midbrain and temporal lobes in one each. T1-weighted MR
      images showed normal findings (two) or signal hypointensity in the thalamus and
      pons in one patient each. Areas of leptomeningeal and parenchymal enhancement
      were identified in one patient each. Brainstem swelling was seen in three
      patients, one of whom had petechial hemorrhage in the pons and hydrocephalus.
      CONCLUSION: Mesenrhombencephalitis is a serious illness that is diagnosed by a
      combination of imaging, clinical, laboratory, and pathologic studies. MR imaging 
      may be crucial to the early diagnosis of this illness, and radiologists must be
      familiar with this uncommon entity and its MR findings in order to make timely
      diagnoses and facilitate treatment.

TI  - Holzgreve syndrome: recurrence in sibs.

AB  - We report on 2 sibs with cardiac and renal abnormalities. The first had
      hypoplastic left heart sequence and renal hypoplasia; the second had a complex
      congenital heart defect, renal agenesis, and cleft lip and palate. We suggest
      that these cases represent the first familial examples of the Holzgreve syndrome.
      As such, they demonstrate the phenotypic variability seen in sibs, and may serve 
      to further delineate the syndrome.

TI  - False-positive MRI detection of recurrent or metastatic pediatric infratentorial 
      tumors.
PG  - 350-5
AB  - Gadolinium-DTPA enhanced MRI is the modality of choice when imaging central
      nervous system infratentorial tumors in the pediatric population. The detection
      of a new enhancing lesion following initiation of therapy is typically considered
      pathognomonic for recurrent or metastatic tumor. We report two pediatric patients
      with infratentorial central nervous system tumors who demonstrated new areas of
      enhancement with gadolinium-DTPA enhanced MRI following initiation of
      multimodality therapy. Both patients had surgical biopsy of the new lesions with 
      histologic review failing to demonstrate viable tumor. These studies suggest
      caution in considering new enhancing lesions detected by MRI in a child with a
      brain tumor pathognomonic for new sites of active tumor.

TI  - Randomized comparison of diaziquone and carmustine in the treatment of adults
      with anaplastic glioma.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase III trial comparing intravenous (IV) diaziquone
      (AZQ) and carmustine (BCNU) as single agents in patients with cerebral anaplastic
      gliomas who had received surgery and radiotherapy. Its purpose was to compare the
      efficacy of AZQ with that of BCNU, the standard agent for brain tumor
      chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomization between the two regimens
      occurred 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. A total of 251 patients were
      randomized to receive either AZQ or BCNU, and there were no significant
      differences between the two treatment arms in any of the known prognostic
      variables, including age, histologic grade, and Karnofsky performance status
      (KPS). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in either time to tumor
      progression or survival between the two treatment arms. Age and histology were
      strong predictors of outcome, whereas KPS had relatively less effect. Three
      groups of patients with distinctly different outcomes could be identified: (1)
      older age (45+) and glioblastoma/gliosarcoma (GBM/GS) patients had a median
      survival of 37 weeks after randomization; (2) patients with either older age or
      GBM/GS had a median survival of 61 weeks; and (3) younger age (< 45) and
      non-GBM/GS (usually anaplastic astrocytoma) patients had a median survival of 147
      weeks. Toxicity was primarily hematologic, although acute gastrointestinal
      toxicity and chronic pulmonary toxicity were more common with BCNU. Patients
      randomized to AZQ who had significant hematologic toxicity that required dose
      reduction after the first treatment cycle had significantly longer time to tumor 
      progression and survival than those who did not require dose reduction (P = .011 
      and .016, respectively). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in
      efficacy between AZQ and BCNU in patients with anaplastic gliomas as tested in
      this study, although AZQ was somewhat better tolerated.

TI  - Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma of the brain: MR findings in six patients.
PG  - 1287-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is a rare, usually benign brain tumor.
      This pleomorphic supratentorial tumor involves the leptomeninges and superficial 
      cortex in young patients with seizures. The MR imaging features of this distinct 
      tumor have not been reported. We describe the MR imaging findings in six patients
      with pathologically proved pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We retrospectively reviewed the MR images of six patients with pathologically
      proved pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. MR images were reviewed by two
      neuroradiologists. The pathologic slides of the tumors were reviewed by two
      neuropathologists. We also analyzed the patients' clinical features. RESULTS:
      Most of the tumors were cortical based and isointense with gray matter on
      T1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. All the masses 
      enhanced with contrast material. Cystic components and gyriform and
      leptomeningeal enhancement were seen occasionally. The tumors occurred in the
      temporal lobes in four of the six patients. Three patients had seizures, and the 
      other three had headaches. CONCLUSION: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is a rare,
      usually benign, cortical-based mass that often enhances intensely with contrast
      material. The most common location is in the temporal lobes. Seizures and
      headaches are common clinical features. Familiarity with this lesion is important
      in the differential diagnosis of enhancing cortical-based masses.

PG  - 753-9
AB  - We investigated CD56+ cells (natural killer cells), CD14+ cells (macrophage) and 
      CD3+ cells (pan T cells) in urine using flow cytometry in various renal diseases 
      including idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy,
      membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis membranous nephropathy, pyelonephritis
      and idiopathic renal hematuria. A remarkable increase of CD56 cells in urine was 
      observed in glomerulonephritis with marked necrotizing/and or crescentic (NC)
      lesions. The ratio of CD56+ cells/CD3+ cells was correlated with the severity of 
      NC lesions. The ratio of CD14+ cells/CD3+ cells was increased in
      glomerulonephritis with endocapillary proliferation. Using immunohistochemical
      methods, CD56+ cells were also observed to be present in cellular crescents in
      biopsy specimens. These observations suggest that an analysis of these cells in
      urine using flow cytometry may be a useful tool for monitoring disease activity
      in proliferative glomerulonephritis.

      thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is reviewed. Compared to most descriptions of
      this disorder, which tend to reflect the international experience with this
      disease, patients with TPP in the United States reflect the ethnic makeup of the 
      local population: the predisposition of patients of Asian origin is very evident,
      but whites are more frequently affected than most previous reports have
      recognized. Hispanics and American Indians also appear to be at increased risk,
      and blacks have also been affected. Except for the fact that hyperthyroidism is
      an absolute requirement for expression of the disease, TPP is identical to
      familial periodic paralysis (FPP) in its clinical presentation. TPP affects
      predominantly males (to an even greater degree than FPP), is rarely associated
      with a positive family history, and has a later onset of presentation than FPP
      (reflecting the need for hyperthyroidism to occur before the disorder can be
      expressed). Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in
      affected patients, but any cause of thyrotoxicosis (including administration of
      excessive amounts of exogenous thyroid hormone) can trigger attacks of TPP in
      susceptible subjects. Clinical features of thyroid disease may be very subtle or 
      virtually nonexistent; as a result, thyroid function tests should be routinely
      monitored in patients with features of hypokalemic paralysis. The pathophysiology
      of the disorder is not well understood. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism
      leads to cessation of periodic hypokalemic paralysis, but symptoms can return
      with recurrence of the hyperthyroid condition. Potassium administration during an
      acute attack will shorten the duration of the episode, and treatment with
      propranolol, potassium supplementation, or spironolactone may prevent attacks in 
      some patients.

TI  - Evaluation of cerebral biopsies for the diagnosis of dementia.
PG  - 28-31
AB  - To identify those patients most likely to benefit from a cerebral biopsy to
      diagnose dementia, we reviewed a series of 14 unselected biopsies performed
      during a 9-year period (1980 through 1989) at Duke University Medical Center,
      Durham, NC. Pathognomonic features allowed a definitive diagnosis in seven
      specimens. Nondiagnostic abnormalities but not diagnostic neuropathologic changes
      were seen in five additional specimens, and two specimens were normal.
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was the most frequent diagnosis. One patient each was
      diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, adult-onset
      Niemann-Pick disease, and anaplastic astrocytoma. We conclude that a substantial 
      proportion of patients presenting clinically with atypical dementia are likely to
      receive a definitive diagnosis from a cerebral biopsy. However, in those with
      coexisting hemiparesis, chorea, athetosis, or lower motor neuron signs, cerebral 
      biopsies are less likely to be diagnostic.

TI  - Influence of the type of surgery on the histologic diagnosis in patients with
      anaplastic gliomas.
PG  - 1741-4
AB  - Stereotactic biopsy of CNS tumors provides a small amount of tissue for
      pathologic diagnosis. This potentially leads to inaccurate grading of gliomas
      because of their histologic heterogeneity. We compared histologic diagnoses in a 
      consecutive series of 329 patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic gliomas whose 
      diagnoses were established by either stereotactic biopsy or open resection. Of
      262 patients undergoing resection, 214 (82%) had glioblastomas and 48 (18%) had
      anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs). Of 67 patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy, 33 
      (49%) had glioblastomas and 34 (51%) had AAs. This difference suggests that some 
      AAs diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy are actually glioblastomas and has important
      implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials.

TI  - FDG-PET in the selection of brain lesions for biopsy.
PG  - 796-801
AB  - The CT-guided stereotaxic needle biopsy has become a widely used procedure in the
      diagnostic evaluation of intracranial lesions including tumors. Conventional CT
      or MR frequently defines the anatomic regions of abnormality, which may be
      multiple lesions or a single lesion that is heterogeneous in cellular composition
      owing to the topographic variation of cellular constituency or the combination of
      active disease, nonspecific inflammation, necrosis, and/or edema. In these cases,
      selection of the most appropriate site for a successful diagnostic needle biopsy 
      can be difficult. In three patients, we have used [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
      positron emission tomography (PET) to determine the site most likely to provide a
      diagnostic biopsy result. In the first patient, who presented with confusion,
      multiple biopsies from the temporal lobe, based on MR abnormalities, revealed
      only reactive gliosis and edema. Repeat biopsy directed by PET revealed an
      anaplastic astrocytoma. In a second patient, PET allowed us to differentiate
      radiation effect from active metastatic breast cancer. In the third patient, who 
      presented with a grand mal seizure, biopsy of a CT-defined hypodense region
      demonstrated lymphocytosis. Metabolism of FDG was normal or increased in areas of
      Aspergillus encephalitis at autopsy. These preliminary studies suggest a
      complementary role for FDG-PET and CT or MR in selected patients for defining the
      intracranial site most likely to yield a positive biopsy result.

      whom the ocular abnormalities included the commonly reported exotropia, myopia,
      small optic nerve, and hypopigmentation of the fundus, as well as rarely reported
      corneal asymmetry, pannus, and atropic irides with irregular pupillary margins.
      The patient also had a cataract in the right eye and a retinal detachment in the 
      left eye.

TI  - The erythrocyte-type glucose transporter in blood vessels of primary and

PG  - 487-91
AB  - We previously demonstrated that brain microvessels have a high density of the
      erythrocyte-type glucose transporter and suggested this could be used as a marker
      of cells with "occluding" junctions. Now, we have studied by immunocytochemistry 
      the tissue distribution of the glucose transporter in a variety of primary and
      metastatic human brain tumors with a monoclonal antibody to the glucose
      transporter of human erythrocytes. Microvessels in normal brain tissue distant
      from the tumor, and in brain surrounding the tumor, immunostained strongly for
      the glucose transporter. Microvessels in primary and metastatic tumors, however, 
      lacked glucose transporter immunoreactivity. Only in the relatively benign
      juvenile cerebellar astrocytomas was glucose transporter immunoreactivity
      retained in some of the tumor microvessels. Because a high glucose transporter
      density is a marker of vessels with barrier properties, our results indicate that
      the vast majority of brain tumor microvessels do nc, have an intact blood-brain
      barrier.

TI  - Risk factors and manifestations of digoxin toxicity in the elderly.
PG  - 11-5; discussion 33-4
AB  - The incidence of digoxin toxicity increases with age, largely because the two
      most common conditions that benefit from use of digoxin, congestive heart failure
      and atrial fibrillation, are markedly more prevalent in old age. Whether the
      elderly are more sensitive to the effects of digoxin because of age per se is
      unclear. However, several other factors render the elderly more susceptible to
      digoxin toxicity. These include an age-related decline in renal function and a
      decrease in volume of digoxin distribution. There is also an increase in the
      number of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, which heighten susceptibility to digoxin toxicity. Moreover,
      treatment of these diseases with such interactive medications as quinidine and
      calcium channel blockers may increase the serum level of digoxin. Similarly, such
      electrolyte imbalances as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia occur more frequently in
      the elderly as a result of diuretic therapy. However, recent data suggest that
      manifestations of digoxin toxicity among younger and older patients do not
      differ. Similar incidences of cardiac toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and
      altered mental status are found in both patient populations. Treatment of
      digitalis toxicity in the elderly is the same as for younger patients. Response
      rates to Digibind are not diminished in the elderly.

PG  - 38-43
AB  - Thrombocytopenia was documented in 987 of 18,910 (5.2%) dogs admitted to North
      Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Teaching
      Hospital, between 1983 and 1989. Classifying thrombocytopenic dogs by etiologic
      groups revealed the following proportionate ratios: 5% (48/987) immune-mediated
      thrombocytopenia; 13% (130/987) neoplasia-associated thrombocytopenia; 23%
      (224/987) inflammatory/infectious thrombocytopenia; and 59% (585/987)
      miscellaneous thrombocytopenia. Dogs with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia had
      significantly (P < 0.05) lower platelet counts (mean 36,760 +/- 50,288
      microliter) than dogs in the other three groups, and Doberman Pinschers were
      overrepresented in all groups except the immune-mediated thrombocytopenic group. 
      We conclude that thrombocytopenia is a prevalent and potentially important
      diagnostic finding in a variety of disease states.

TI  - Experimental studies of the hematologic and immune system toxicity of nucleoside 
      derivatives used against HIV infection.
PG  - 99-107
AB  - Adverse effects stemming from the therapeutic use of dideoxynucleoside
      derivatives continue to occur in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. For 
      example, the continued use of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and
      2',3'-didoxycytidine (ddC), both of which confer clinical benefits in AIDS
      patients, may be complicated by anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and ddC 
      also causes peripheral neuropathy. Subsequently, the National Toxicology Program 
      (NTP) has undertaken efforts to define and characterize the toxicities associated
      with currently employed and potential AIDS therapeutics in experimental animals, 
      with particular emphasis on the hematopoietic and immune systems. In addition to 
      AZT and ddC, 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and
      2',3'-didehydrodideoxythymidine (d4T) have been examined. The present studies
      describe: (1) the development of a poorly regenerative macrocytic anemia in mice 
      exposed to AZT or ddC. This anemia demonstrates a rapid and progressive time
      course of toxicity and reversibility after cessation of treatment; (2) the
      selective suppression of erythroid progenitor cells in mice exposed to d4T
      without concomitant effects on myeloid stem cells. Myelotoxicity appears to show 
      metabolism-dependent strain-specificity and is more evident following in vitro
      exposure than in vivo exposure; and (3) the immunosuppressive effects following
      subchronic (30-day) exposure. Of the nucleoside derivatives studied, only ddA and
      ddI altered immune function and these changes were confined to suppression of
      antibody responses. It can be concluded that the overall similarities in the
      hematopoietic and immune system effects between rodents and humans indicate that 
      such animal toxicology studies provide important information relevant to the
      toxicity of these drugs.

      II3(NeuAc)2GgOse3Cer (GD2) were produced by immunizing mice with the

      GD2 coupled to Salmonella minnesota. Two IgM mAbs were isolated which
      demonstrated high levels of reactivity (binding ratios in excess of 100) with GD2
      by solid-phase radioimmunoassay and positivity in high-performance thin-layer
      chromatography (HPTLC) immunostain; only one (DMAb-20) was subsequently shown by 
      analysis with a panel of defined ganglioside species to be specific for the
      minimum epitope of GD2 GalNAc beta 1-4(NeuAc alpha 2-8-NeuAc alpha 2-3)Gal-,
      DMAb-20 was used to evaluate the expression of GD2 by malignant glioma and
      medulloblastoma cell lines using cell surface radioimmunoassay. indirect membrane
      immunofluorescence. HPTLC immunostain, and densitometric analysis of extracted
      gangliosides from selected cell lines. Sixteen of 20 (80%) malignant glioma and 5
      of 5 medulloblastoma cell lines reacted with DMAb-20; in agreement with previous 
      studies, 5 of 5 neuroblastoma and 2 of 3 melanoma cell lines also reacted with
      DMAb-20, GD2 was proportionally increased in the glioma and medulloblastoma cell 
      lines relative to levels in normal brain, as determined by densitometric
      analysis. In a phenotypic survey of malignant glioma biopsies, tumor cells in 24 
      of 30 (80%) cases stained positively with DMAb-20. Reactive astrocytes, both
      within the adjacent to tumors, were frequently intensely stained. Among the
      morphological variants of glioblastoma examined, the most intense staining with
      DMAb-20 was observed in neoplastic gemistocytes, with the weakest or absent
      staining in small cell glioblastomas. As GD2 is a commonly expressed surface
      antigen of gliomas and medulloblastomas, expression of which is retained in
      tissue culture. DMAb-20 will be useful in determining the functional role of GD2 
      in cell-cell interaction, adhesion, and invasion, and in defining altered growth 
      control mechanisms of central nervous system neoplasms in in vitro models.

TI  - Anomalous biliary ducts associated with duodenal atresia.
PG  - 1266-9
AB  - Duodenal atresia is rarely associated with anomalous biliary ducts that permit
      communication between the proximal and distal duodenal segments. Two such cases
      are presented herein and the literature is reviewed. Although the typical
      radiographic pattern of duodenal atresia is the "double bubble" sign with absence
      of distal bowel gas, air may be present in the distal bowel when anomalous bile
      ducts provide a conduit around the atretic segment. Contrast studies are
      generally not performed in the typical clinical and radiographic evaluation of
      duodenal atresia; however, an upper gastrointestinal series may be useful in
      defining the more complex anomaly. Clinical presentation may occur relatively
      late if the biliary communication is large enough to permit passage of some milk 
      or formula. Care should be taken at surgery to avoid obstruction or injury to the
      anomalous bile ducts, and operative cholangiography may be useful to document
      continued bile duct patency following repair of the atresia. Theories of the
      etiology of this anomaly relate to interference with recanalization of the
      duodenum by the process of hepaticopancreatic duct formation and persistence of
      the primitive "dual duct" stage.

TI  - Silica-associated systemic sclerosis is clinically, serologically and
      immunologically indistinguishable from idiopathic systemic sclerosis.
PG  - 725-34
AB  - To determine whether the clinical, immunological and serological features of
      patients with silica-associated systemic sclerosis are different from patients
      with the 'idiopathic' form of systemic sclerosis (SS) we studied 22 underground
      coal miners who were exposed to silica dust (SD), 30 mine workers who later
      developed silicosis (S) and 17 mine workers exposed to silica dust who
      subsequently developed a systemic sclerosis-like disease (SA-SS). The patients
      with SA-SS had features clinically indistinguishable from individual patients
      with SS. They all had Raynaud's phenomenon, 14 had cutaneous sclerosis identical 
      to that seen in acrosclerosis and three had a generalized cutaneous sclerosis.
      Sixteen patients had bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis, 10 had necrosis of the
      fingertip pulps, nine had oesophageal involvement and only one patient had renal 
      involvement. Antinuclear antibodies and circulating immune complexes were
      detected in three and eight patients with SD, 14 and five patients with S and in 
      16 and nine patients with SA-SS, respectively. Anti-Scl-70 antibody was detected 
      in eight of the 17 patients with SA-SS. Evidence for in vivo endothelial cell
      damage, as determined by elevated levels of von Willebrand factor, was found in
      nine patients with SD, 14 patients with S and in 10 patients with SA-SS.
      Following incubation of the patient's serum with confluent cultures of human
      umbilical vein endothelial cells there was only a significant reduction in
      calcium ionophore-induced release of prostacyclin with the serum from SA-SS
      patients compared to that with control serum (NC). The mean +/- SEM release of
      6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin expressed as ng/10(4)
      cells) decreased from 2.90 +/- 0.27 to 2.01 +/- 0.33 (SD), 3.34 +/- 0.42 to 1.76 
      +/- 0.31 (S), 1.98 +/- 0.12 to 0.64 +/- 0.07 (SA-SS) and 2.28 +/- 0.33 to 1.36
      +/- 0.21 (NC) with 1 and 20% serum, respectively. This study demonstrates that
      immune complex and antinuclear antibody formation and in vivo endothelial cell
      damage occurs following occupational exposure to silica. The patients who
      subsequently develop a systemic sclerosis-like disease have clinical,
      immunological and serological features which are indistinguishable from the
      idiopathic form of the disease although as a group the SA-SS patients have a
      higher prevalence of pulmonary involvement and the anti-Scl-70 antibody.

PG  - 251-5
AB  - Diffuse, cutaneous mastocytosis is a rare variant of cutaneous mast cell
      infiltration that can arise in neonates or infants as a generalized bullous
      eruption. The mode of transmission is suggested as autosomal dominant. We report 
      four infants from two unrelated families with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis
      whose cutaneous disease was not controlled by initial therapies. Treatment of the
      four infants with photochemotherapy dramatically reduced or eliminated symptoms. 
      One course of therapy resulted in improvement, and retreatment has not been
      required two to six years later.

TI  - Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. A new neurocutaneous
      syndrome with normal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity.
PG  - 1485-90
AB  - A number of inherited disorders of cornification have been related to abnormal
      lipid metabolism. In the recessively inherited Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, defined 
      by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spasticity, fatty
      alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency has recently been reported. These patients
      accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old
      woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in
      whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol
      level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural 
      studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal
      lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with
      ichthyosis. We postulate that this patient has a novel neurocutaneous syndrome
      that may be secondary to abnormal lipid metabolism.

TI  - Psychogenic seizures in brain injury: diagnosis, treatment and case study.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - Psychogenic seizures are a functional phenomena in which a person experiences a
      paroxysmal event that may be interpreted as epileptiform in nature. By
      definition, psychogenic seizures imply a sudden episode of change in behaviour or
      psychic state that is not associated with an identifiable process, either
      vasculogenic or neurogenic, and during which there is an absence of
      characteristic epileptiform changes on the electroencephalogram. Prevalence rates
      range from 5% to 50% in outpatient populations seen in epilepsy clinics. However,
      approximately 20% of true seizure patients also have psychogenic seizures. As
      psychogenic seizures are not a pathophysiological phenomena, pharmacological
      interventions do not alter their aetiology and can cloud the cognitive skills
      necessary to ameliorate the psychogenic seizure behaviour. In non-aphasic true
      seizure patients, as well as psychogenic seizure patients, self-control
      relaxation paradigms have been successful where pharmacological intervention has 
      failed. This case involved an aphasic brain-injured patient who had both
      psychogenic and true seizures. For this patient, the self-control paradigm was
      modified to include use of gesture and prosody to achieve similar
      psychotherapeutic effects. Additionally, family therapy was instituted to provide
      a constructive means for the patient's family to participate in the reduction of 
      psychogenic seizures. As seizures are a common sequelae of brain injury, the
      differential diagnosis of seizures and knowledge of standard and alternative
      treatment is essential for rehabilitation professionals.

TI  - [Interstitial brachytherapy for malignant gliomas using the Brown-Roberts-Wells
      (BRW) stereotactic system].
PG  - 829-36
AB  - Eleven patients harboring recurrent or deep-seated malignant gliomas were treated
      by interstitial brachytherapy with 192Ir seed assembly, between June 1987 and
      September 1989. Implantations for the afterloaded catheter were performed using
      the Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) CT guided stereotactic system. The number of seeds 
      and the distribution of the implants were chosen in such a way that the minimum
      tumor dose of 30-50Gy could be delivered to the surface or 1cm beyond the rim of 
      the contrast enhancement. The radioactive sources were held in the afterloaded
      catheters that were removed after the desired dose had been delivered. Response
      to therapy was measured by serial CT scans and clinical examination. Tumor
      regressions were seen by CT scans made 2 or 3 months after implantation. One
      tumor showed complete regression (CR), four showed partial response (PR), one
      showed minor response (MR) and 5 showed no change (NC). Overall response rate was
      54%. Six patients died 3 to 18 months following implantation, and five are still 
      alive 7 to 27 months after implantation. No complications such as infection or
      hemorrhage were observed during the treatment. A patient harboring large (6.5cm
      in diameter) recurrent glioblastoma in the rt. parietal robe required a
      craniotomy due to the mass growing for one and half month after implantation, and
      radiation necrosis of the entire tumor mass was documented. The technique of
      stereotactic interstitial implantation was clinically well tolerated and easily
      reproducible and our preliminary results seemed encouraging. Technical
      improvement to achieve an adequate isodose distribution to cover the tumor volume
      might lead to improved survival rates.

TI  - [A combined chemo-endocrine therapy with tegafur, adriamycin, methotrexate and
      tamoxifen for advanced renal cell carcinoma].
PG  - 1652-6
AB  - Six patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma was treated with a new
      chemo-endocrine regimen consisting of Tegafur, Adriamycin, Methotrexate and
      Tamoxifen. Estrogen receptor was measured in four cases from renal or metastatic 
      tumors by DCC method, presenting 14.7, 9.7, 1.0 and 0 f moles/mg protein
      respectively. The patients were medicated with 800-1,200 mg of Tegafur and 20 mg 
      of Tamoxifen daily po, and 20 mg of Adriamycin and 10 mg of Methotrexate
      intermittently for two weeks interval iv. According to a criteria of Japan
      Society for Cancer Therapy, two were regarded as CR, one as PR, one as NC and two
      as PD. The one out of two cases with and without estrogen receptor responded
      favourably to this therapy. Side effects observed in the treatment were mild
      gastrointestinal disorders including nausea and vomiting, slight degree of
      leukopenia, stomatitis, pigmentation and liver dysfunction. The patients were
      found to be in good quality of life during the treatment because of less
      toxicity. This therapy can be regarded as a good modality for a treatment of
      advanced renal cell carcinoma. This is a first report of combined chemo-endocrine
      therapy with Tegafur, Adriamycin, Methotrexate and Tamoxifen for renal cell
      carcinoma in the world.

AB  - Though rarely encountered in women of childbearing age, untreated pernicious
      anemia has been found to be a cause of infertility. Once treated, conception
      often occurs within months. The case presented here is a woman who had a
      restoration of fertility after initiation of vitamin B12 treatment for
      vitiligo-associated pernicious anemia. Previous reports have shown the occurrence
      of pregnancy in treated pernicious anemia, but none has indicated the presence of
      vitiligo in the same patient. Pernicious anemia is a rare but treatable cause of 
      infertility in women.

PG  - 558-9
AB  - The case of a neonate presenting with respiratory distress who had an
      incarcerated Bochdalek hernia with perforation and meconium peritonitis and
      pleuritis is reported. The patient had an associated jejunal atresia in an
      incarcerated segment of intestine, which undoubtedly contributed to the
      obstruction, strangulation, and perforation in the incarcerated hernia.
      Gastrointestinal complications attributable to the hernia are most unusual in the
      neonate, and aggressive preoperative resuscitation and stabilization with the
      earliest possible surgical intervention are imperative features in management.

TI  - Growth and adherence of xeroderma pigmentosum keratinocytes in vitro.
PG  - 342-5
AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which cells
      are unable to repair ultraviolet light-induced DNA defects. Keratinocytes were
      obtained from the right medial leg of a 16-year-old girl with XP. Two donor sites
      were harvested: One was an obviously damaged area; the second was an area that
      had been harvested five years previously and now grossly appeared normal. The
      cells were plated on untreated plastic tissue culture dishes. All XP
      keratinocytes grew much faster and spread more rapidly than non-XP controls.
      There was a 1.5 to 2.5 times increase in the growth rate of XP cells from the
      obviously damaged area over XP cells from the normal-appearing area. The XP
      keratinocytes also showed an in vitro expressed alteration in adhesion compared
      with control keratinocytes, which appears to be independent of the cell growth
      rate.

TI  - HIV-1-associated thrombocytopenia. The role of splenectomy.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - Thrombocytopenic purpura is a common hematologic abnormality occurring in
      individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1. Of the nearly 
      two million people infected with HIV-1, approximately 11% have platelet counts of
      less than 100,000/mm3. If no etiology other than HIV-1 infection can be found for
      the thrombocytopenia, the syndrome is referred to as HIV-1-associated
      thrombocytopenia (HAT). Steroids lead to an improvement in the platelet count in 
      60% to 80% of effected individuals but the majority of those who respond cannot
      maintain a normal platelet count when steroids are withdrawn. Furthermore concern
      over chronic steroid therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals has led to the
      investigation of other forms of treatment for this syndrome. This report
      describes the experience at Duke University Medical Center with eight patients
      who developed HAT and subsequently underwent splenectomy. In this group there was
      1 complete response, 5 partial responses, and 2 patients who did not respond.
      There were no perioperative deaths and minimal perioperative morbidity. No
      evidence for the progression of HIV-1 infection in asymptomatic patients after
      splenectomy to AIDS related complex (ARC) or to the acquired immune deficiency
      syndrome (AIDS) was seen. In addition no increase in the susceptibility to
      infections by encapsulated organisms as a result of splenectomy was observed
      after a mean follow-up of 13.25 months. A review of 79 other cases reported in
      the literature suggests a higher response rate than that observed in our
      patients. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed and an algorithm defining
      the role of splenectomy in the management of HAT is presented.

TI  - Immunocytochemical evaluation of central nervous system tumors obtained by the
      Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator.
PG  - 308-12
AB  - The Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) is a dissecting system that
      allows quick and effective removal of CNS tumors without traction or excessive
      manipulation of normal tissue. In this article, the immunoperoxidase staining
      patterns of cytology specimens obtained with the CUSA are compared with those
      from their corresponding resected surgical specimens employing a battery of
      monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Eleven cases of meningioma, three cases of 
      glioblastoma multiforme, one astrocytoma, and two schwannomas were evaluated. In 
      both CUSA cytologic biopsies and surgical biopsies, all the meningiomas showed
      strong staining for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen, while two showed
      focal staining for cytokeratins. The glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma
      cases showed positivity for vimentin, S-100 protein, and glial fibrillary acidic 
      protein, while the schwannomas stained positively for vimentin and S-100 protein.
      With only rare exceptions, the immunocytochemistry of the CUSA and surgical
      specimens correlated well in all of these cases in terms of strength of reaction 
      and localization. There were no false-positive staining reactions in the CUSA
      material. This study suggests that reliable morphologic and immunoperoxidase
      studies can be performed on cytologic material obtained by the CUSA, which could 
      aid in making an accurate and specific diagnosis of a variety of CNS tumors.

TI  - Cytopathology of neoplasms of the central nervous system in specimens obtained by
      the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator.
PG  - 576-82
AB  - The Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) is a dissecting system that
      removes tissue by vibration, irrigation and suction; fluid and particulate matter
      from tumors are aspirated and subsquently deposited in a canister. The CUSA
      permits the neurosurgeon to remove large tumors by debulking them quickly and
      effectively, without traction or manipulation and with minimal transmission of
      movement to adjacent normal tissues. The cytomorphologic appearances of 22
      central nervous system tumors in CUSA samples were evaluated and compared with
      the findings in biopsy or resection specimens. Papanicolaou-stained and
      Diff-Quik-stained Cytospin preparations were prepared from the saline irrigation 
      fluid along with a cell block in every case. Three specimens (13.6%) were
      insufficient for interpretation. Of the materials from seven astrocytic neoplasms
      examined, two were insufficient for diagnosis. The other insufficient case was
      tissue obtained from an ependymoma. All 11 meningiomas had diagnostic material in
      the slides and cell blocks. In general, the cytologic smears and cell block
      preparations were best preserved in meningiomas and schwannomas. Varying degrees 
      of degeneration were noted in the glial neoplasms. Since tissue obtained from the
      CUSA may represent the bulk of the specimen, the examination of cytologic smears 
      and especially cell blocks from the tissue that "went down the sucker" and were
      previously discarded may be quite useful.

PG  - 159-61
AB  - A child with congenital ocular fibrosis syndrome and oculocutaneous albinism
      displayed two distinct neural misdirection syndromes: synergistic divergence and 
      Marcus Gunn jaw winking. This and other reported cases of misdirected innervation
      in patients with congenital fibrosis syndrome suggest that normal neuronal
      connections fail to become established early in development and that lack of
      innervation may underlie the pathologic features of the disorder. The prevailing 
      concept of congenital fibrosis syndrome as a primary myopathy should be
      reconsidered.

TI  - Computer imaging analysis of glomerular extracellular components in patients with

PG  - 296-305
AB  - Computer imaging analysis was used for quantitative evaluation of the extents,
      amounts and distributions of glomerular extracellular components, such as the 7S 
      and NC-1 domains of type IV collagen, laminin (LN), fibronectin (FN) and IgA, in 
      glomeruli from patients with IgA nephropathy. Renal biopsy specimens from 13
      patients with IgA nephropathy were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies
      against the FN or non-collagenous (NC-1) domain of type IV collagen or polyclonal
      antiserum against the LN or 7S domain of human type IV collagen, and then stained
      with appropriate dilutions of FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig antisera. Marked
      staining of the 7S or NC-1 domain of type IV collagen, LN or FN was detected in
      the glomerular capillary walls and/or mesangial areas in patients with IgA
      nephropathy. In particular, a prominent increase of FN was observed in the
      subendothelial regions of glomerular capillary walls, i.e. mesangial
      interposition, in the moderate or advanced stage of IgA nephropathy. Therefore,
      computer imaging analysis was shown to be useful for the quantitative
      determination of such components distributed in glomeruli from patients with IgA 
      nephropathy.

TI  - Criteria for termination of phase II chemotherapy for patients with progressive
      or recurrent brain tumor.
PG  - 62-6
AB  - We report six patients with progressive primary tumors of the brain who had
      prolonged periods with stable contrast-enhancing CT lesions following initial
      responses to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was discontinued after 21 to 36 months,
      despite the persistence of apparent disease in each patient. PET using (F-18)
      fluorodeoxyglucose was performed in three patients, revealing hypometabolic
      lesions. All six patients are alive and well, with no clinical or radiographic
      evidence of progressive disease at 24 to 57+ months following termination of
      treatment. The usual criteria for terminating phase II chemotherapy in patients
      with a recurrent brain tumor are evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable 
      toxicity. However, chemotherapeutic success mandates that these criteria be
      expanded to include patients whose response following the initiation of phase II 
      treatment is followed by prolonged (greater than 1 year) radiographic and
      clinical stability. Complete response, ie, disappearance of all evidence of
      disease, is unusual in patients with recurrent primary brain tumors, even with
      highly effective therapy. Continued improvement in the therapy of patients with
      these tumors will allow wider application of these criteria.

AB  - A study of anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) from patients 
      with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is described. The relationship between
      the deposition of IgA and the detection of glomerular extracellular components,
      i.e., noncollagenous (NC-1) domain of Type IV collagen, in the glomerular
      capillary walls was examined by double immunofluorescence. Renal biopsy specimens
      from patients with IgA nephropathy were immersed in polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a 
      cationic probe and then examined by electron microscopy. Renal specimens were
      also incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-NC-1 domain of Type IV collagen and
      then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled goat antimouse Ig
      antiserum. After these reactions, sections were stained with rhodamine-labelled
      rabbit antihuman IgA antiserum. GBM subepithelial anionic sites marked by PEI
      were altered by the deposition of electron-dense deposits (EDD) in patients with 
      IgA nephropathy and there was a significant correlation between the levels of
      proteinuria and the incidence of EDD in the GBM in such patients. Marked
      proteinuria was observed in patients who showed loss of anionic sites in the GBM 
      by electron microscopy. By double immunofluorescence, IgA was shown to be focally
      deposited outside the NC-1 domain of Type IV collagen-detected regions in the
      same patients. The authors concluded that high levels of proteinuria might be due
      to alterations of the size barrier and/or anionic sites of GBM in the moderate
      stage of IgA nephropathy.

PG  - 137-43
AB  - A study of immunofluorescence of unfractionated Type IV collagen, non-collagenous
      (NC-1) domain of Type IV collagen, basement membrane (GBM) component detected by 
      Goodpasture's syndrome patient's serum and laminin (LN) in the glomeruli from 10 
      patients with IgA nephropathy was described. Type IV collagen, non-collagenous
      (NC-1) domain of Type IV collagen, GBM component or LN was observed linearly in
      the glomerular capillary walls in all patients with IgA nephropathy examined. The
      deposition of IgA, IgM or C3 was marked in the glomerular capillary walls in
      patients in the moderate or advanced stage of IgA nephropathy. However, the
      staining of Type IV collagen, GBM component or LN in such walls was not altered
      by the depositions of IgA, IgM and C3. In particular, a wrinkled pattern of NC-1 
      domain of Type IV or GBM component was detected in the glomerular capillary walls
      of totally sclerotic glomeruli in some patients with IgA nephropathy. It appears 
      that the deposits of IgA and/or C3 did not influence the major components of
      glomerular capillary walls in patients with IgA nephropathy. It is concluded that
      the initiating factors of the collapse and/or sclerosis of glomerular capillary
      walls might be due to various factors other than the deposition of glomerular
      IgA-dominant immune-complexes in patients with IgA nephropathy.

      Taiwan.
PG  - 334-6
AB  - In 1979, a mass poisoning occurred in Taiwan from cooking oil contaminated by
      thermally degraded polychlorinated biphenyls. Because these chemicals persist in 
      human tissue, children born to female patients after the outbreak were exposed in
      utero. In 1985, 117 children born to affected women and 108 unexposed controls
      were examined and evaluated. The exposed children were shorter and lighter than
      controls; they had abnormalities of gingiva, skin, nails, teeth, and lungs more
      frequently than did controls. The exposed children showed delay of developmental 
      milestones, deficits on formal developmental testing, and abnormalities on
      behavioral assessment. These findings are most consistent with a generalized
      disorder of ectodermal tissue. This syndrome is one of very few documented to
      result from transplacental exposure to pollutant chemicals.

TI  - Does maternal platelet-associated or platelet-bindable IgG correlate with levels 
      in umbilical cord blood or colostrum during normal pregnancy?
PG  - 430-4
AB  - Existing data regarding the ability to predict neonatal thrombocytopenia during
      maternal immune thrombocytopenia are confusing. We studied normal pregnancies (n 
      = 20) to define normal values and the correlation between maternal and umbilical 
      cord platelet counts, platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG), and
      platelet-bindable IgG. The postpartum serum platelet-bindable IgG level was
      measured to evaluate peripartum changes and the correlation with colostrum
      platelet-bindable IgG (n = 6). The mean maternal platelet count was 181,500
      cells/cm3 mm and the mean umbilical cord platelet count was 293,500 cells/mm3.
      The median maternal platelet-associated IgG was 803 molecules per platelet,
      umbilical cord platelet-associated IgG was 791 molecules per platelet, maternal
      platelet-bindable IgG was 92 molecules per platelet, and umbilical cord
      platelet-bindable IgG was 256 molecules per platelet. The postpartum median
      maternal platelet-bindable IgG was 333 molecules per platelet and for colostrum
      it was 297 molecules per platelet. No clinically useful correlations for
      predicting the neonatal platelet count during normal pregnancy were found. Normal
      pregnancies may have high levels of maternal- or umbilical cord
      platelet-associated IgG, perhaps due to nonspecific binding.

      myositis, and muscle biopsy showed a nonspecific diffuse myositis. The clay was
      shown to act as a potassium binder. With potassium replacement and discontinuance
      of clay ingestion, the symptoms and signs abated and laboratory values returned
      to normal.

TI  - The autonomic dysfunction syndrome: aetiology and treatment.
PG  - 471-8
AB  - Nine patients with autonomic dysfunction syndrome (ADS) characterised by
      sympathetic discharge and extensor posturing are presented. Morphine was given to
      three patients and in all cases consistently stopped the episodes. Dantrolene was
      given to one patient and reduced the severity of the extensor posturing without
      affecting the other components of the ADS. Bromocriptine was given to three
      patients and appeared to have both short- and long-term effects. Acutely, the
      drug partially corrected the hyperthermia and diaphoresis associated with these
      episodes. Two patients were given bromocriptine long-term. In one patient, the
      ADS was completely controlled and in the other, the frequency of the episodes
      decreased. The autonomic dysfunction syndrome appears to be related to both
      severe closed head injury and acute hydrocephalus. The clinical similarity of the
      two diverse etiologic groups and the absence of precipitating increased ICP in
      the former suggests the common theme is a release of the brain stem from higher
      control. The responses to morphine and bromocriptine suggest that the opiate and 
      dopaminergic pathways play roles in the entity.

PG  - 273-6
AB  - In order to study the presence of possible renal damage, 12 patients who had been
      chronically treated with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol therapy, 1,25(OH)2D3, for 
      hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and hypophosphatemic rickets were
      examined by renal ultrasound. Two patients had normal values while 10 subjects
      showed nephrocalcinosis (NC) of mild, medium, or severe degree. The echographic
      results have been related to some calcium-phosphorus metabolism and therapeutic
      parameters. In those subjects with medium to severe NC, the age at the beginning 
      of therapy was significantly younger and the dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 was
      significantly higher, than in the other patients. Laboratory data were not
      predictive of NC. Renal ultrasound is, therefore, a useful means of screening to 
      detect even early stages of NC; its use in the follow-up is also recommended.

TI  - The three lines: origin of sonographic landmarks in the fetal head.
PG  - 1009-12
AB  - Antenatal sonography consistently reveals three parallel echogenic lines on
      high-axial scans of the fetal head. Previous descriptions of fetal intracranial
      anatomy assumed that the inner line originates from the interhemispheric fissure 
      and that the outer lines originate from the lateral walls of the lateral
      ventricles. By studying the three lines sonographically in 25 fetuses and by
      injecting contrast material into the deep venous system of autopsy specimens, we 
      showed that the outer two lines do not represent the lateral walls of the lateral
      ventricles, but rather appear to arise from deep intracerebral veins. This
      finding challenges the validity of lateral ventricular hemispheric ratios in the 
      diagnosis of early hydrocephalus, since such calculations assume that the outer
      lines originate from the ventricular walls rather than from veins. The results of
      this study reveal that the two outer lines most likely originate from deep
      cerebral veins, rather than from the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles.

TI  - Splenectomy for primary and recurrent immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
      Current criteria for patient selection and results.
PG  - 529-41
AB  - Of 565 patients with thrombocytopenia admitted to Duke University Hospital
      between 1975 and 1985, 100 had splenectomy. Ninety-eight patients had failed
      chronic immunosuppressive therapy and three patients had acute intracranial
      bleeding or total absence of platelets in the peripheral blood smear, and had
      urgent splenectomy. At primary splenectomy, accessory spleens were identified and
      resected in 18% of patients. There was no operative mortality. Fifty-eight
      patients had an excellent response to splenectomy and their steroids were tapered
      off within 3 weeks. Thirteen patients had a poor response to primary splenectomy 
      of whom eight remitted spontaneously and five required accessory splenectomy
      resulting in complete remission in three patients. Twenty-nine patients were
      considered nonresponders, 25 of whom had radionuclide scanning for accessory
      spleens. Seven of these patients had accessory spleens identified but only four
      consented to accessory splenectomy. In three of the four patients, a complete
      remission was achieved. Neither platelet antibody titers nor measurements of
      platelet survival or turnover predicted platelet response to splenectomy.
      However, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in older patients was
      significantly less likely to respond to splenectomy. These data support
      continuing use of splenectomy in selected patients with ITP and an aggressive
      search for accessory spleens in patients who relapse since they are easily
      localized at operation by hand-held isotope detector probe.

PG  - 53-75
AB  - The National Toxicology Program's pathology database on 2-year carcinogenicity
      studies was reviewed for nonneoplastic ovarian disease. Ovaries from 39,941
      female Fischer rats and 41,444 female B6C3F1 mice were examined. A variety of
      inflammatory, degenerative, vascular, and proliferative lesions were documented
      and are described. The most common ovarian lesions in rats were cysts (6%). The
      most frequent ovarian lesions in mice were cysts (15%), acute inflammation (4%), 
      degeneration (4%), vascular disease (2.5%), and atrophy (2%). There was no
      difference in incidence of ovarian disease between controls and treated animals. 
      The frequency of ovarian disease in mice exceeded the frequency in rats in every 
      category.

TI  - The significance of ventriculomegaly in the newborn with myelodysplasia.
PG  - 239-41
AB  - Hydrocephalus occurs in 69% to 92% of the meningomyelocele population, but rarely
      becomes manifest until after the meningomyelocele is closed. Ventriculomegaly is 
      common at birth, even in neonates without overt hydrocephalus. Thus, palpating
      the anterior fontanel and cranial sutures and measuring the head circumference
      may be misleading. We report a means of identifying spina bifida neonates who
      will subsequently develop hydrocephalus. Dubowitz gestational age, birth weight, 
      birth head circumference, head circumference percentile, and the lateral
      ventricular ratio (LVR) from ultrasonograms were analyzed for each of 25 neonates
      with meningomyelocele. The mean head circumference percentile was 47.7 +/- 7.7 SE
      (range: less than 5 to greater than 95). Ventriculomegaly, however, defined by an
      LVR of greater than 0.32, was present in all but 2 of the neonates. Pearson's
      correlation test showed that only one-third of the elevated LVRs could be
      explained by the head circumference. Later ventricular shunting was eventually
      required in all but 3 infants. We concluded that (1) clinical examination of the 
      myelodysplastic neonate usually does not reveal evidence of hydrocephalus and (2)
      ventriculomegaly on ultrasonography predicts the later development of
      hydrocephalus following meningomyelocele closure.

TI  - Treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--related Kaposi's sarcoma with
      lymphoblastoid interferon.
PG  - 506-12
AB  - Twelve homosexual patients with Kaposi's sarcoma associated with the acquired
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were treated with a preparation of purified
      human lymphoblastoid interferon (Wellferon [Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle
      Park, NC]). They were given a dose of 20 X 10(6) U/m2 intramuscularly daily for
      approximately two months. Responders continued their treatment on a maintenance
      schedule of 20 X 10(6) U/m2 three times a week. Four patients experienced
      complete remissions, and four experienced partial remissions that resulted in a
      total response rate of 67%. The median duration of treatment was 14 weeks (7 to
      28+ weeks), and the median response duration was 28+ weeks (19 to 29+ weeks). Of 
      the four patients in complete remission, one relapsed at 25 weeks and one at 26
      weeks; the other two remained in complete remission at 28 and 29+ weeks. The
      clinical toxicity consisted of chills, fever, fatigue, and asthenia. Hematologic 
      toxicity was similar to that previously described for other preparations of
      alpha-interferon and consisted of moderate leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
      Asthenia, a condition present in all 12 patients, was severe in 50%. A minimal
      tumor burden, the absence of circulating interferon before treatment, and a
      performance status of greater than or equal to 90% on the Karnofsky scale were
      related to an improved response rate. Measurement of immunologic parameters
      showed significant declines in the already impaired T cell levels, lymphocyte
      blastogenic response to concanavalin A, monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity, and monocyte-adherence. Activation of natural killer cells
      was not noted, and no life-threatening infections occurred during treatment.
      These data suggest that human lymphoblastoid interferon is an active agent in the
      treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma, and its use warrants further study in a larger
      number of patients.

TI  - [Synchronization chemoradiotherapy for malignant gliomas].
PG  - 795-805
AB  - Cellular synchronization chemoradiotherapy was performed in 122 patients with
      glioblastoma and malignant astrocytoma (GrIII) registered between April 1977 and 
      August 1982. The study was a non-randomized clinical phase II trial. The
      chemotherapeutic agents employed as synchronizers during the irradiation were
      VM26 (epipodophyllotoxin) and vincristine (VCR) as plant alkaloids and ACNU as a 
      nitrosourea. Either VM26 or VCR was administered on D1, D2 and D3 at the dosage
      of 1 mg/kg (0.025 mg/kg-VCR) body weight. ACNU was administered on D2 and D3 at
      the dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight. The duration of the chemotherapy was eight to 
      fourteen days at the initial induction stage and almost eight weeks at the
      maintenance stage. Thus, two synchronization arms of VM26 + ACNU and VCR + ACNU
      were employed. The regimen-VM 26 + ACNU + Radiation (Rad) could yield the initial
      induction of CR + PR-30%, NC-50%, and PG-15% in 58 cases. Long-term survival,
      calculated by the cumulative survival rate, was as follows: one year, 58%; two
      years, 42%; three years, 32%; four years, 30%, and five years, 25%. The regimen
      VCR + ACNU + Rad could yield the initial induction of CR + PR-28%, NC-49%, and
      PG-23% in 64 cases. The cumulative survival rate was calculated as follows: one
      year, 55%; two years, 42%; three years, 27%; four years, 22%, and five years,
      22%. As a control, particularly for the survival rate, the data of the All-Japan 
      Registry were revised to correspond to our study population. The survival rate of
      simple radiation cases thus revised was as follows: one year, 43%; two years,
      23%; three years, 11%; four years, 7%, and five years, 5%. The comparison between
      VM 26 plus ACNU and VCR plus ACNU yielded a higher initial induction response of 
      35% for the former (vs. 28% for the latter), although it is difficult to make a
      judgement on the excellence of the regimen involving VM 26 plus ACNU, because
      this trial was clinical phase II. On the other hand, compared with the data from 
      the All-Japan Registry, each regimen of cellular synchronization radiation
      therapy could achieve statistically more excellent responses both in the initial 
      induction and the long-term survival (p less than 0.01). Thus, cellular
      synchronization radiation therapy is a hopeful therapeutic method for malignant
      glioma, with less side effects and statistically confirmed higher
      responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

PG  - 361-7
AB  - In vitro sensitivity test of cultured human malignant glioma cells to
      ACNU[1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl) methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea
      hydrochloride] was performed on Falcon 3064 microtestplate. Early culture cells
      established from 10 clinical cases were examined by means of this method and the 
      correlation between in vitro response and clinical response of tumor to ACNU was 
      studied. In microtestplate assay, it was defined as ACNU sensitive when the tumor
      growth showed more than 60% suppression when tumor was cultured in the medium
      which contained 40 meg/ml of ACNU. Clinical responses were evaluated by means of 
      CT scan, being divided into 4 classes, PR (partial response), CR (complete
      response), NC (no change) and PD (progressive disease). The former two groups
      were regarded as responder and the latter two as nonresponder. The
      correlationship between in vitro response and clinical response was higher in
      resistant group (100%) than in the sensitive group (60%), so the resistant tumor 
      can be checked with this method. For this reason, the use of this assay may prove
      helpful in the selection of the chemotherapeutic agents.

TI  - [The primary optical projection in albino and pigmented rats].
PG  - 257-86
AB  - 1. We have studied by silver degeneration methods in transversal and horizontal
      brain series the pathways and the terminal nuclei of the primary optic system in 
      albino and pigmented rats. 2. About 90% of the retinal axons are crossing in the 
      Chiasma opticum. Differences between albino and pigmented rats are small. At the 
      level of the lateral geniculate body (l.g.b.) the axons ramify. One branch is
      going in the optic tract or in the transversalsystem to the pretectum and tectum.
      The other branch goes as a collateral in the longitudinal system of the dorsal
      l.g.b. and ends here. 3. The optic fibers project--especially contralateral--to
      the following nuclei: veutral l.g.b. (lateral half), dorsal l.g.b., nucleus of
      the optic tract, Nc. olivaris praetectalis, Ncc. praetectales anterior et
      posterior and superior colliculus (laminae I-III). In the nuclei of the pretectal
      region are ipsilateral only a few degenerating fibers. 4. Especially in the
      dorsal l.g.b. but also in the superior colliculus the pigmented rats show
      ipsilateral an larger retinal input. 5. The ipsilateral fibers project to a
      special region in the dorsal l.g.b. This region is also innervated by
      contralateral axons. 6. In both the albino and pigmented rats the dorsal l.g.b.
      shows no lamination in the cytoarchitectonical picture and the ipsi- and
      contralateral input regions overlap. Therefore in the rat we can not speak from a
      laminated dorsal l.g.b. We have here--prepoperantly functional caused--a simple
      form of l.g.b. 7. The accessory optic system is only decussated. It includes the 
      Fasciculus inferior tr. opt. accessorius, who projects only and direct to the
      median terminal nucleus and the Fasciculus superior tr. opticus accessorius. The 
      last goes off from the optic tract at the level of the pretectal region and
      innervates all the 3 accessory optic nuclei. 8. In a few preparates we found
      references for a direct retino-hypothalamic connection (Nc. suprachiasmaticus and
      Nc. arcuatus hypothalami).
