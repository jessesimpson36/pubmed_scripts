# steps to acquire the data I retrieved:
I gathered a list of the rare diseases and seperated them with
vertical bars. 

I then divided that list into 4 pieces and ran each query on 
pubmed's website and downloaded all of the results as a txt
file formatted

Then I used medlinegrepper.sh to grep the fields I wanted.

Then I used used pubmed_to_csv.py to convert the results to a csv file.
